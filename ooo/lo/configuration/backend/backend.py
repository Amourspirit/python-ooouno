    Service Class

    provides access to a configuration database composed of one or more storage backends containing settings used by software modules.
    
    Configuration data is organized into layers which are selected by components and entities.
    
    Components are characterized by configuration schemas. A component contains configuration data for a particular application domain or software module.
    
    Entities are organized hierarchically in organizations, groups, roles and individual users. Each element of the associated hierarchy corresponds to a layer that applies to an entity.
    
    A layer contains data for multiple components associated to a single entity.
