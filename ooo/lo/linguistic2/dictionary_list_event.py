    Struct Class

    structure representing a dictionary-list event.
    
    This structure is used by the dictionary-list to inform its listeners about certain events. Since the dictionary-list is able to collect several single events before broadcasting them to its listeners the integer argument may be a combination (logical or) of several event types. If more specific information about the events is requested by a listener, a sequence of all dictionary-list events since the last broadcasting will be supplied. Otherwise, that list will be empty.
