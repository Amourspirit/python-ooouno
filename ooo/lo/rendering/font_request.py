    Struct Class

    This structure contains all information necessary to describe a font to be queried from XCanvas.
    
    Note: Outline fonts are to be requested as a special family, set FontInfo.FamilyName appropriately. Emboss/relief must be emulated by upper layers.
    
    Leave the FontInfo.FamilyName and FontInfo.StyleName empty, if font selection should only happen via the PANOSE description.
