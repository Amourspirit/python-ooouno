    Singleton Class

    specifies a factory that creates instances of registered popup menu controller.
    
    A pop-up menu controller can be registered for a command URL and a model service name. A menu bar or context menu will automatically create a pop-up menu controller if it contains a registered command URL.
    
    Prior to LibreOffice 4.3, this singleton was only available as a (single-instance) PopupMenuControllerFactory service.
    
    **since**
    
        LibreOffice 4.3
