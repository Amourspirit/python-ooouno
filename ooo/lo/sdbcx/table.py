    Service Class

    used to specify a table in a database.
    
    A table is described by its name and one or more columns.
    
    In addition, it may contain indexes to improve the performance in the retrieval of the table's data and keys, and to define semantic rules for the table.
    
    Note:  All properties and columns of a table could by modified before it is appended to a database. In that case, the service is in fact a descriptor. On existing tables, a user might alter columns, add or delete columns, indexes, and keys depending on the capabilities of the database and on the user's privileges.
