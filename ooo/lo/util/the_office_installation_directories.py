    Singleton Class

    encapsulates access to the current office installation directory and office user data directory, provides functionality to create URLs containing relocatable (not absolute) references to the current office installation directory and user data directory and vice versa.
    
    This functionality is useful when data containing references to the current office installation directory or user data directory must be made persistent and re-read later. In many cases, storing the reference directly would destroy the relocatability of an office installation and the possibility to share one office user data directory among parallel office installations.
