    Service Class

    describes a container which provides access to database related definitions like commands, forms, and reports.
    
    The container supports access to its elements by the elements name or by the elements position.
    
    Simple enumeration must be supported as well.
    
    To reflect the changes with the underlying database, a refresh mechanism needs to be supported.
