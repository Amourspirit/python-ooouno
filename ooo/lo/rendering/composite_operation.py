    Const Class

    These constants determine how the primitive color is combined with the background.
    
    When performing these calculations, it is assumed that all color values are premultiplied with the corresponding alpha values (if no alpha is specified, 1.0 is assumed). Then, the following general compositing operation is performed:
    
    C = Ca * Fa + Cb * Fb
    
    where C is the result color, Ca and Cb are the input colors, premultiplied with alpha, and Fa and Fb are described for the different composite modes (wherein Aa and Ab denote source and destination alpha, respectively).
