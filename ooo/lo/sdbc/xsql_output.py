    is used as an output stream for writing the attributes of a user-defined type back to the database.
    
    This interface, used only for custom mapping, is used by the driver, and its methods are never directly invoked by a programmer.
    
    When an object of a class implementing interface com.sun.star.sdbc.XSQLData is passed as an argument to a SQL statement, the JDBC driver calls com.sun.star.sdbc.SQLData.getSQLType() to determine the kind of SQL datum being passed to the database. The driver then creates an instance of XSQLOutput and passes it to the method com.sun.star.sdbc.XSQLData.writeSQL() . The method writeSQL in turn calls the appropriate XSQLOutput.writeXXX methods to write data from the com.sun.star.sdbc.XSQLData object to the XSQLOutput output stream as the representation of a SQL user-defined type.
