    Service Class

    This service specifies a radio button which is data-aware and thus can be bound to a database field, and additionally supports binding to arbitrary external values.
    
    The com.sun.star.form.binding.XValueBinding instance which can be associated with a BindableDatabaseRadioButton must support exchanging boolean values. The following mapping between external values and control states apply:
    
    If the value binding associated with a BindableDatabaseRadioButton supports exchanging string values, and the com.sun.star.form.component.RadioButton.RefValue is not empty, then the radio button will exchange its value as string:

        com.sun.star.form.component.RadioButton.RefValue is transferred to possible external value bindings as soon as the radio button is selected. With the member SecondaryRefValue, clients of the radio button can also associate a value with the not selected state of the control.
