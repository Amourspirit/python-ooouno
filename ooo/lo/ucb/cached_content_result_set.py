    Service Class

    is used on client side to access a ContentResultSet remote optimized.
    
    The CachedContentResultSet will not load every single property or even row just in that moment you ask for it, but load the data for some rows beforehand.
    
    Every time when a new package of data is loaded, the so far loaded data will be released, so the cash will not grow and grow and grow.
