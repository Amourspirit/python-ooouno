        A RuntimePermission contains a name (also referred to as a \"target name\") but no actions list; you either have the named permission or you don't.

            | At runtime RuntimePermission will be an actual uno struct however can seamlessly be treated as a regualr class.
            | At design time a class is presumed. This allows for better typings.
            | RuntimePermission is a callable and can be treatead as a class and create instances.
