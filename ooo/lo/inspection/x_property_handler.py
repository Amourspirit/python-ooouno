        Besides defining an own set of properties (see getSupportedProperties()), a property handler can also declare that foreign properties (which it is not responsible for) are superseded by its own properties.
        
        This is usually used if your handler is used with another, more generic one, which should continue to be responsible for all properties, except a few which your handler handles more elegantly.
        
        In such a case, simply return those properties here.
        
        There is a precedence in the property handlers used by an ObjectInspector, which also is important for the superseded properties. This precedence is implied by the precedence of factories to create the property handlers, as denoted in the XObjectInspectorModel.HandlerFactories attribute.
        
        With this in mind, property handlers can only supersede properties which are supported by a handler preceding them, but not properties of handlers succeeding them.
        
        For instance, imaging an XObjectInspectorModel which provides three factories, for handler A, B, and C - in this order. Now if A supports the property Foo, C supports Bar, and B supersedes both Foo and Bar, them the result is Bar is still present. This is because B precedes C, so it cannot, by definition, supersede properties which are supported by C.

        An object inspector can inspect multiple components at once, displaying the intersection of their properties. For this, all components are examined for their properties, and all properties which exist for all components, and are declared to be composable by their respective handler, are displayed in the inspector UI.

        called when a browse button belonging to a property UI representation has been clicked
        
        Property handlers can raise a dedicated UI for entering or somehow changing a property value. Usually, this will be a modal dialog, but it can also be a non-modal user interface component.
        
        Availability of this feature is indicated by the LineDescriptor.HasPrimaryButton and LineDescriptor.HasSecondaryButton members of a LineDescriptor, which the XPropertyHandler fills in its describePropertyLine() method.
        
        When this method is called, the property handler should raise the UI needed to enter the property value, and return the result of this (see InteractiveSelectionResult).
        
        It is recommended that property handlers do not directly set the property value which has been obtained from the user, but store it in the output-parameter Data, and return InteractiveSelectionResult.ObtainedValue.
        
        If a handler sets the new property value directly, and returns InteractiveSelectionResult.ObtainedValue, this implies that the property cannot properly be handled in case the object inspector is inspecting an intersection of multiple components, since in this case onInteractivePropertySelection() will be called at one handler only, however the new property would have to be forwarded to all handlers.
        
        If a property is not composable, directly setting the new property value does not yield any problem, as long as property listeners are properly notified of the change.
