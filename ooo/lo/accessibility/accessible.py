    Service Class

    Every class has to support this service in order to be accessible.
    
    It provides the means to derive a XAccessibleContext object–which may but usually is not the same object as the object that supports the XAccessible interface–that provides the actual information that is needed to make it accessible.
    
    Service Accessible is just a wrapper for the interface XAccessible. See the interface's documentation for more information.
