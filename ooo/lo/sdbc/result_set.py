    Service Class

    provides access to a table of data.
    
    A ResultSet object is usually generated by executing a Statement.
    
    A ResultSet maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of data. Initially the cursor is positioned before the first row. The \"next\" method moves the cursor to the next row.
    
    The getXXX methods retrieve column values for the current row. You can retrieve values using either the index number of the column. Columns are numbered from 1.
    
    For maximum portability, ResultSet columns within each row should be read in left-to-right order and each column should be read only once.
    
    For the getXXX methods, the SDBC driver attempts to convert the underlying data to the specified type and returns a suitable value.
    
    Column names used as input to the findColumn method are case insensitive. When several columns have the same name, then the value of the first matching column will be returned. The column name option is designed to be used when column names are used in the SQL query. For columns that are NOT explicitly named in the query, it is best to use column numbers. If column names are used, there is no way for the programmer to guarantee that they actually refer to the intended columns.
    
    A ResultSet is automatically closed (disposed) by the Statement that generated it when that Statement is closed, re-executed, or used to retrieve the next result from a sequence of multiple results.
    
    The number, types, and properties of a ResultSet's columns are provided by the ResultSetMetaData object returned by the getMetaData method.

        defines the SQL cursor name that will be used by subsequent Statement execute methods.
        
        This name can then be used in SQL positioned update/delete statements to identify the current row in the ResultSet generated by this statement. If the database doesn't support positioned update/delete, this property is a noop. To ensure that a cursor has the proper isolation level to support updates, the cursor's SELECT statement should be of the form \"select for update ...\". If the \"for update\" phrase is omitted, positioned updates may fail.
        
        Note:  By definition, positioned update/delete execution must be done by a different Statement than the one which generated the ResultSet being used for positioning. Also, cursor names must be unique within a connection.
