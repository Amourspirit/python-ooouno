    Service Class

    An interaction request handler that uses the com.sun.star.task.PasswordContainer service to handle com.sun.star.ucb.AuthenticationRequest.
    
    If the password container contains credentials matching the authentication request, the service implementation selects the com.sun.star.ucb.XInteractionSupplyAuthentication continuation, that should be supplied with the interaction request.
    
    If the password container does not contain credentials matching the authentication request, the service implementation selects no continuation.
