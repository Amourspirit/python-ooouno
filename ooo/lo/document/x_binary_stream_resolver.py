    This interface encapsulates functionality to get/resolve binary data streams. It is used to transform binary data to a URL or to transform a URL to binary data. The binary data is represented through input and output streams.
    
    In the case of transforming a URL to binary data, the getInputStream method is used. This returns a com.sun.star.io.XInputStream from which the binary data, transformed from the given URL, can be read.
    
    In the case of transforming binary data to a URL, a com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream is created first to write the binary data to. After this, the resolveOutputStream method can be used to transform the binary data, represented through the com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream interface, to a URL.
