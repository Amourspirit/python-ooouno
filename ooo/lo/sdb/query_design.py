    implements a component which allows the creation of SQL statements.
    
    This service implements a user interface for creating SQL statements either through a graphical design interface or simply to enter the SQL statement directly.
    
    The design view of the QueryDesign is divided into two parts. The first part contains the table windows where columns can be selected for the SQL statement. The second part contains the columns which should appear in the selection of the SQL statement or criteria which narrow the query.
    
    A QueryDesign component has 3 operation modes, which control what kind of object is edited:
    
    Initialization is done using the com.sun.star.lang.XInitialization interface, which expects a sequence of objects being either com.sun.star.beans.NamedValues or com.sun.star.beans.PropertyValues. The following parameters are supported at initialization time:
