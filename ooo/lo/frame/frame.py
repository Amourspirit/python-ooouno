    Service Class

    represents the environment for a desktop component
    
    Frames are the anchors for the office components and they are the component's link to the outside world. They create a skeleton for the whole office API infrastructure by building frame hierarchies. These hierarchies contains all currently loaded documents and make it possible to walk during these trees. A special service Desktop can(!) combine different of such trees to a global one which life time will be controlled by it.
