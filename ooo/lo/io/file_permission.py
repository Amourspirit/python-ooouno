    Struct Class

    This permission represents access to a file or directory.
    
    A FilePermission consists of a file url and a set of actions valid for that url.
    
    The path of the file url that ends in \"/*\" indicates all the files and directories contained in that directory. A path that ends with \"/-\" indicates (recursively) all files and subdirectories contained in that directory. A file url string consisting of the special token \"<<ALL FILES>>\" matches any file. Note: A file url string consisting of a single \"*\" indicates all the files in the current directory, while a string consisting of a single \"-\" indicates all the files in the current directory and (recursively) all files and subdirectories contained in the current directory. The actions to be granted is a list of one or more comma-separated keywords. The possible keywords are \"read\", \"write\", \"execute\", and \"delete\". Their meaning is defined as follows:
    
    The actions string is processed case-insensitive.
