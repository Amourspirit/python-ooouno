        Both text objects and text content objects may only be connected to each other if they are created by the same component. When implementing new components, this behavior is deprecated.

        The reason why a text table still needs an anchor is that for example tables should be insertable via com.sun.star.text.insertTextContent and that interface uses a parameter of that type.
