    Service Class

    A FilePicker.
    
    It is NOT recommended to cache a reference to a file picker instance. Due to restrictions by the underlying system there can be specific limitations possible. To overcome these problems it's recommended to create a new instance on demand.

        Provides the ability to choose between different custom templates that do extend the subset of common controls a FilePicker usually supports.
        
        Implementers may omit this interface if the FileOpen dialog doesn't support custom templates. In this case a createInstance will create an ordinary FileOpen dialog with only the common FilePicker elements. The client has to provide one of the specified constants in TemplateDescription.
        
        Notes for the implementation of a FileSave dialog: The implementation of a FileSave dialog should automatically check for existence of a file and issue a warning if a file with the same name already exist.
        
        Note that when creating a file picker, the top window is selected as the parent window for the file picker. Make sure that it does not get closed while opening the file picker, as there is a potential race.
