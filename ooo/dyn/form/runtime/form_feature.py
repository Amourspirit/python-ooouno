        moves the form to a record given by absolute position.
        
        This operation cannot be executed without arguments. When executing it (i.e. when calling com.sun.star.form.runtime.XFormOperations.executeWithArguments()), you need to specify a parameter named Position of type long, which denotes the position to move the form to.

        determines the number of total records in the form, including the potentially active insertion row.
        
        This is not strictly an operation you can do on a form, but rather a state you can retrieve (and display to the user) using the XFormOperations's respective methods.
        
        The state obtained here is a string, not a number. This is because in an UI form, the fact that the current record count is not yet known (since not all records have been visited, yet) is indicated by an asterisk (*) besides the record count.

        adds a filter to the form, which is defined by the active form control and its current value
        
        For instance, if the currently active form control is bound to a table field named Price, and currently has a value of 100, then invoking the AutoFilter operation will put an additional filter Price = 100 on the form.
