    Service Class

    controls the layout of user interface elements which are part of a frame.
    
    Layout management is the process of determining the size and position of user interface elements. By default, each Frame has a layout manager â€“ it performs layout management for the user interface elements within the frame. User interface elements can provide size and alignment hints to layout managers, but layout managers have the final decision on the size and position of those user interface elements.
