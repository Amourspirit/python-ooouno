    """
    A cache of preview bitmaps for the slides of one Impress or Draw document in one size.
    
    There may be more than one cache for one document. These are internally connected and for missing previews one cache may take it from another cache and scale it to the desired size. When a preview is not present then it is created asynchronously. On creation all registered listeners are notified.
    
    Slides are referenced via their index in an XIndexAccess container in order to allow multiple references to a single slide (custom presentations).
