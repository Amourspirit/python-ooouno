    Const Class

    Collection of relation types.
    
    This list of constants defines the available types of relations that are usable by AccessibleRelation.
    
    We are using constants instead of a more typesafe enum. The reason for this is that IDL enums may not be extended. Therefore, in order to include future extensions to the set of roles we have to use constants here.
