    Const Class

    These constants are used to specify database data types which are used to identify the generic SQL types.
    
    The definition is based on JDBC 3.0.
    
    The actual type constant values are equivalent to those in the X/Open CLI.
    
    Precise information about the specific types can be got from XDatabaseMetaData.getTypeInfo().
