        connects a storage to the user interface configuration manager which is used on subsequent calls of load() and store().
        
        This call needs careful usage as data loss can occur. If the implementation has modified data and a new storage is set the implementation is not allowed to write back the data to the old storage. This must be done explicitly with store(). In general a user interface configuration manager instance is created and initialize by the document model or the module user interface configuration supplier. Normally there is no need to set a storage for a user interface configuration manager. If a copy of the configuration data to another storage should be made, use storeToStorage().
