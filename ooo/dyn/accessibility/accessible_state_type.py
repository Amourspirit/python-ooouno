        Enum of Const Class AccessibleStateType

        Collection of state types.
        
        This list of constants defines the available set of states that an object that implements XAccessibleContext can be in.
        
        The comments describing the states is taken verbatim from the Java Accessibility API 1.4 documentation.
        
        We are using constants instead of a more typesafe enum. The reason for this is that IDL enums may not be extended. Therefore, in order to include future extensions to the set of roles we have to use constants here.

Now it is no longer necessary to iterate over all children to find out whether they are transient or not to decide whether to add listener or not.
