        Enum of Const Class DatabaseObjectContainer

        denotes different types of (maybe virtual) containers of database objects
        
        In the database application of OpenOffice.org, database objects (such as tables, queries, forms, reports) can be organized in folders. This hierarchy can be imposed externally, or internally.
        
        For example, when you connect to a database which supports catalogs and/or schemas, then those impose a natural order on the tables, in that a catalog or a schema is a folder of tables.
        
        On the other hand, for forms and reports, OpenOffice.org Base itself allows the user to create folders to organize the documents - in this case, the hierarchy is defined in the database document itself.
