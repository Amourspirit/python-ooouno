    Service Class

    Provides a collection of implementations of services.
    
    The factories for instantiating objects of implementations are accessed via a service name.
    
    The com.sun.star.container.XContentEnumerationAccess interface can be supported optionally. If it is supported, it is possible to enumerate all implementations that support the service specified with the argument of com.sun.star.container.XContentEnumerationAccess.createContentEnumeration(). The enumerator returns interfaces. The type of the interface is not specified. Commonly this is XSingleComponentFactory.
