    specifies a sub document of an OfficeDatabaseDocument.
    
    Usual instances of a DocumentDefinition are forms and reports.
    
    Note that the DocumentDefinition does not denote the actual document (i.e. an object supporting the com.sun.star.frame.XModel interface), but only a shortcut to access and load those actual documents.
