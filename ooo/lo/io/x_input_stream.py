        This method is very similar to the readBytes method, except that it has different blocking behaviour. The method blocks as long as at least 1 byte is available or EOF has been reached. EOF has only been reached, when the method returns 0 and the corresponding byte sequence is empty. Otherwise, after the call, aData contains the available, but no more than nMaxBytesToRead, bytes.
