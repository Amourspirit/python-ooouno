    indicates support for executing scripts contained in a, possibly foreign, document.
    
    If the component implementing it is a document, which supports embedding scripts into itself, then ScriptContainer refers to the document itself. Implementing this interface is unnecessary then, instead the document should simply implement XEmbeddedScripts directly.
    
    If the interface is implemented by a document which does not itself support embedding scripts into it, but which is associated unambiguously with a document which does, then this other document is denoted by ScriptContainer.
    
    If the interface is implemented by a controller, then ScriptContainer refers to the document which supports embedding scripts, and which is unambiguously associated with the controller. This must not necessarily be the model returned by com.sun.star.frame.XController.getModel().
