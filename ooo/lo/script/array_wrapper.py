class ArrayWrapper(object):

    Struct Class

    Allows a UNO sequence that is passed between different language boundaries to indicate it prefers to be represented as a multidimensional array with 0 or 1 based indices.
    
    UNO does not natively represent Multi-Dimensional arrays, instead a sequence can have elements that are themselves sequences (an array of arrays ).
    
    Some languages ( example BASIC ) can natively represent both Multi-Dimensional arrays and array of arrays. Those languages could represent a sequence of sequences as either a Multi-Dimensional array or array of arrays. This structure allows a preference for a Multi-Dimensional array representation to be specified.
