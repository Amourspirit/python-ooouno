    Singleton Class

    This singleton offers the document event functionality that can be found at any com.sun.star.document.OfficeDocument, but it does it for all existing documents.
    
    So it is a single place where a listener can be registered for all events in all documents.
    
    Prior to LibreOffice 4.3, this singleton was only available as a (single-instance) GlobalEventBroadcaster service.
    
    **since**
    
        LibreOffice 4.3
