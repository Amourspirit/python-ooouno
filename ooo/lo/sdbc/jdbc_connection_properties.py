    Service Class

    represents the properties for a JDBC connection (session) with a specific database.
    
    These properties can be used when calling the method com.sun.star.sdbc.XDriver.connect() or com.sun.star.sdbc.XDriverManager.getConnectionWithInfo().
    
    The properties for a connection contain additional information about how to connect to a database and how to control the behavior of the resulting connection should be.
