    There will be only one list that may hold different types of conversion dictionaries. That is e.g. it may hold dictionaries for Korean Hangul/Hanja conversion along with ones for Chinese traditional/simplified conversion or conversion between different Indic script types.
    
    The list will be used by the text conversion service to check for user supplied text conversions.
