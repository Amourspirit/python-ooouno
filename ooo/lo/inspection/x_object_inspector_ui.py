    grants access to certain aspects of the user interface of an object inspector
    
    This interface is used as callback for XPropertyHandlers.
    
    As a consequence, methods operating on the UI for a property, and taking the name of this property, are tolerant against properties which do not exist. For instance, if a property handler tries to disable the UI for property Foo, but another handler has superseded this property, then the ObjectInspector will not have any UI for it. In this case, the call to enablePropertyUI( \"Foo\" ) will simply be ignored.
