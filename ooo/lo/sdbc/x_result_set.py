    provides the navigation on a table of data.
    
    A com.sun.star.sdbc.ResultSet object is usually generated by executing a com.sun.star.sdbc.Statement.
    
    A ResultSet maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of data. Initially the cursor is positioned before the first row. The \"next\" method moves the cursor to the next row.

        If the row number is positive, the cursor moves to the given row number with respect to the beginning of the result set. The first row is row 1, the second is row 2, and so on.
        
        If the given row number is negative, the cursor moves to an absolute row position with respect to the end of the result set. For example, calling absolute(-1) positions the cursor on the last row, absolute(-2) indicates the next-to-last row, and so on.
        
        An attempt to position the cursor beyond the first/last row in the result set leaves the cursor before/after the first/last row, respectively.
        
        Note: Calling absolute(1) is the same as calling com.sun.star.sdbc.XResultSet.first(). Calling moveToPosition(-1) is the same as calling moveToLast().

        Cannot be called when on the insert row. The refreshRow method provides a way for an application to explicitly tell the SDBC driver to refetch a row(s) from the database. An application may want to call refreshRow when caching or prefetching is being done by the SDBC driver to fetch the latest value of a row from the database. The SDBC driver may actually refresh multiple rows at once if the fetch size is greater than one. All values are refetched subject to the transaction isolation level and cursor sensitivity. If refreshRow is called after calling updateXXX , but before calling com.sun.star.sdbc.XResultSet.updateRow() , then the updates made to the row are lost. Calling the method refreshRow frequently will likely slow performance.

        Attempting to move beyond the first/last row in the result set positions the cursor before/after the first/last row. Calling relative(0) is valid, but does not change the cursor position.
        
        Note: Calling relative(1) is different from calling com.sun.star.sdbc.XResultSet.next() because is makes sense to call next() when there is no current row, for example, when the cursor is positioned before the first row or after the last row of the result set.
