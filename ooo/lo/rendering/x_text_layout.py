    This is the central interface for text layouting.
    
    This is the central interface for text-related tasks more complicated than simple string rendering. Note that all query methods are subject to the current layout state of this object. That is, calls to XTextLayout.justify() or XTextLayout.applyLogicalAdvancements() are likely to change subsequent output of those query methods.
    
    Similar to XCanvasFont, all measurements and coordinates accepted and returned by this interface are relative to the font's local coordinate system (which only equals device coordinate space, if the combined render transformation used during text output is the identity transformation). Conversely, if the combined transformation used during text output is not the identity transformation, all measurements returned by this interface should be subjected to that transformation, to yield values in device coordinate space. Depending on the underlying font technology, actual device output might be off by up to one device pixel from the transformed metrics.

        This method applies the specified advancements to every logical character in the input string (not for every glyph. There might be multiple glyphs per input character, or multiple input characters per glyph). This is useful to explicitly manipulate the exact output positions of characters, e.g. relative to a reference output device.

        This method can be used to combine the layout of a text line into a single justification run. This is e.g. useful if the line consists of several text portions (e.g. because of different fonts or colors), but it is desirable to spread the available space more globally across the different layout objects. If, for example, one layout object contains significantly more whitespace or Kashidas than the rest, this method can assign proportionally more space to this layout object.
