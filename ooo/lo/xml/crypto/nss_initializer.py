    Service Class

    This service has a particular lifecycle.
    
    If you create an instance, the NSS backend is not initialized, until some of the crypto functions are called. As a result you can effectively change the user setting to the NSS path until NSS is really used.
    
    After the first usage you have to restart LibreOffice to activate a new NSS path.
    
    **since**
    
        LibreOffice 4.0
