    the basic interface to be used to access linguistic functionality.
    
    This interface is used to access spell checker, hyphenator, and thesaurus functionality. Additionally, it can query what implementations of those services are available (for specific languages or in general). It can select and query which of those implementations should be used for a specific language.
    
    For spell checking and thesaurus, the order in the list defines the order of creation/usage of those services. That is, if the first spell checker implementation does not recognize the given word as correct, the second service implementation for that language is created and gets queried. If that one fails, the third one gets created and queried and so on. This chain stops if an implementation reports the word as correct or the end of the list is reached, in which case the word is reported as incorrect.
    
    For the thesaurus, the behavior is the same when no meaning was found.
