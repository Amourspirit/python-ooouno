    Service Class

    is used to specify views on data.
    
    A view object is only used for creation and deletion. Inspecting the command of a view is normally not supported.
    
    If a view is going to be added to a database, the view must have a unique name within the view and the table container, as it can be used like a table.  Note:  After addition, both the containers for views and the container for tables must contain an element for the view.
