    Service Class

    specifies a diagram which can be used for presenting stock quotes.
    
    Note that the data must have a specific structure for stock diagrams. Let us assume that data is interpreted, such that series are taken from columns (see property Diagram.DataRowSource). Then you need tables of the following structures for different types:
    
    StockDiagram.Volume is FALSE
    StockDiagram.UpDown is FALSE
    
    StockDiagram.Volume is TRUE
    StockDiagram.UpDown is FALSE
    
    StockDiagram.Volume is FALSE
    StockDiagram.UpDown is TRUE
    
    StockDiagram.Volume is TRUE
    StockDiagram.UpDown is TRUE
