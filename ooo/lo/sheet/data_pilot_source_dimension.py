    represents a dimension in a data pilot source.
    
    A dimension is equivalent to a column of a cell range in a spreadsheet used for a data pilot field.
    
    In more complex data sources, a dimension may contain several hierarchies, which consolidate items of a complex data type, called levels.
    
    Example: In a database, a column contains date values. This column will be a dimension of the data pilot source. One hierarchy may contain the 3 levels year, month, day. Another hierarchy may contain the 2 levels year and week number.
