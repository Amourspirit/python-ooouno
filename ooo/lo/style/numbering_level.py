        This is more flexible way to provide multilevel numbering with complex format string. This property is a replacement for Prefix and Suffix: if ListFormat is provided, they are not used anymore.
        
        Example: ListFormat \"(%1% %2%.%3%)\" can be resolved to numbering in actual multilevel list like \"(4 1.3)\".
