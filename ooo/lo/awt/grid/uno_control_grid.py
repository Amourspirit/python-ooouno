    Service Class

    A control that displays a set of tabular data.
    
    The horizontal structure of the grid is defined by the XGridColumnModel implemented in DefaultGridColumnModel The XGridColumn implemented in GridColumn describes the properties and behavior of a single column. Use the XGridColumnModel.addColumn() to add a column to the column model.
    
    All row data are stored in the XGridDataModel. Use the DefaultGridDataModel to add XGridDataModel.addRow() or remove XGridDataModel.removeRow() rows.
    
    The column and data model must be set at the UnoControlGridModel.ColumnModel and UnoControlGridModel.GridDataModel properties.
    
    If you are interested in knowing when the selection changes implement a XGridSelectionListener and add the instance with the method XGridRowSelection.addSelectionListener(). You than will be notified for any selection change.
