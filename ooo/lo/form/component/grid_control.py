    Service Class

    specifies a model for a control which can display form data in a table-like way.
    
    In opposite to other form controls, grid controls do not only display the single current value of a column they are bound to. Moreover, they do display not only the current row of the form, but all rows (at least potentially, limited by the control size, of course).
    
    The table rows in a grid control correspond to the rows in the DataForm the control belongs to, and the columns correspond to single columns of the form's row set.
    
    Columns of a grid control are modeled by own objects, too. They are very similar to usual com.sun.star.form.DataAwareControlModels modeling other \"single-value\" controls, but they are not described as own services. Instead, they need to be created using the com.sun.star.form.XGridColumnFactory interface.
