    specifies a (form) component which is bound to a data source.
    
    The interface provides the possibility of committing its respective data to a data source it is bound to. A commit() will be performed by the environment (usually, a FormController).For example, suppose you have a data-bound control that is connected to a database field. Each time the control loses its focus, the model (component) of the control is triggered by the environment to store its value in the database field.
    
    A commit may fail if an XUpdateListener vetoes the it.
