    Singleton Class

    is the environment for components which can instantiate within frames
    
    A desktop environment contains tasks with one or more frames in which components can be loaded. The term \"task\" or naming a frame as a \"task frame\" is not in any way related to any additional implemented interfaces, it's just because these frames use task windows.
    
    Prior to LibreOffice 4.3, this singleton was only available as a (single-instance) Desktop service.
    
    **since**
    
        LibreOffice 4.3
