        """
        retrieves an index in a global property ordering, for a given property name
        
        In the user interface of an ObjectInspector, single properties are represented by single lines, and those lines are displayed successively. To determine an order of the property lines, the inspector model can associate an \"order index\" with each property. The ObjectInspector will then sort the property lines in a way that they have the same relative ordering as the \"order indexes\" of their properties.
        
        Note that the concrete value the model returns for a given property does not matter. All what matters is that if you want a certain property Foo to be displayed after another property Bar, then the order index of Foo should be greater than the order index of Bar.
        
        If for two different properties the same order index is returned, the ObjectInspector will assume the order in which those properties were provided by the respective property handler (XPropertyHandler.getSupportedProperties()).If two such properties originate from different handlers, they will be ordered according to the order of the handlers, as provided in the HandlerFactories attribute.

        This attribute is usually only evaluated by the ObjectInspector instance which the model is currently bound to.
        
        The order of factories is important: If two property handlers declare themselves responsible for the same property, the one whose factory is listed last wins. Also, if a handler B wants to supersede a property of another handler A, A's factory must precede the factory of B.
