    Service Class

    implements a property handler for use with a com.sun.star.inspection.ObjectInspector which, for a com.sun.star.form.FormComponent, provides the script events offered by this form component.
    
    For this, the parent of the form component, which by definition supports the com.sun.star.form.FormComponent service, is examined for the com.sun.star.script.XEventAttacherManager interface.
