    Service Class

    specifies a component which acts as a radio button as needed in HTMLForms.
    
    Radio buttons are controls which can be grouped together, and in every group, only one of the controls can be check. This means if one of them is checked by a user interaction, all other controls in the same group are automatically unchecked
    
    Like in HTML, radio buttons are grouped together if and only if they have the same name (see com.sun.star.form.FormComponent.Name).
