        This method can be used only for links implementations that implement the whole set of embedded object interfaces. Usually the sets of interfaces are the same for links and objects. An example of exception from this are OOo links that do not implement XEmbedPersist interface. For such cases the method will throw an exception.
        
        The link will be broken and the linked object will become a normal embedded object.
