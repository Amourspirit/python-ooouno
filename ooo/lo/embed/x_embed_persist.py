        provides object with a parent storage and a name for object's entry.

        The object should be stored to the new entry, after that the entry should be remembered by the object. After the storing process is finished the XEmbedPersist.saveCompleted() method can be used to specify whether the object should use the new entry or the old one. The object persistence can not be used until XEmbedPersist.saveCompleted() is called. So this state can be treated as \"HandsOff\" state.
