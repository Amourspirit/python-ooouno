    is used to identify rows within a result set and to find rows by a bookmark.
    
    Bookmarks are only valid in the scope of the current result set and are not interchangeable between result sets. A bookmark could be a complex data structure, so it could not be compared in a safe way. Because of that, a provider has to implement the compare method for bookmarks.
