    specifies the operations for a hatch window.
    
    A hatch window is a kind of window that is adopted to contain an embedded object window to represent the contained window border and to handle resizing/moving in a specific way: after user have selected the new size/placement the hatching window sends request to owner for resizing/moving. Thus the window can not resize/move itself.
