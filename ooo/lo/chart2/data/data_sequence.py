    describes a container for a sequence of values.
    
    With the interface XDataSequence it is possible to transfer a complete sequence of values.
    
    With the optional com.sun.star.container.XIndexReplace it is possible to modify single elements, if the corresponding DataProvider supports modification of its values.
