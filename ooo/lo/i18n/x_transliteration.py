    Character conversions like case folding or Hiragana to Katakana.
    
    Transliteration is a character to character conversion but it is not always a one to one mapping between characters. Transliteration modules are primarily used by collation, and search and replace modules to perform approximate search. It can also be used to format the numbers in different numbering systems.
    
    In order to select transliteration modules for different purposes, they are classified with attributes of TransliterationType.
    
    For Western languages there would be three transliteration modules available to compare two mixed case strings: upper to lower, lower to upper, and ignore case.
    
    A typical calling sequence of transliteration is
    
    or another one is
