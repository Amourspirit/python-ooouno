    Service Class

    is a client side ResultSet, which combines the characteristics of a com.sun.star.sdbc.Statement and a com.sun.star.sdbc.ResultSet.
    
    It acts like a typical bean. Before you use the RowSet, you have to specify a set of properties like a DataSource and a Command and other properties known of Statement. Afterwards, you can populate the RowSet by its execute method to fill the set with data.
    
    On the one hand, a RowSet can be used as a short cut to retrieve the data of a DataSource. You don't have to establish a connection, create a Statement, and then create a ResultSet. On the other hand, a row set can be used to implement capabilities for a result set, which are not supported by a driver result set, like caching strategies or update capabilities.
