    Service Class

    implements a property handler for use with a com.sun.star.inspection.ObjectInspector which is able to provide properties to bind a form component to a spreadsheet cell.
    
    The handler expects a value named \"ContextDocument\" in the context in which it is created. That is, the com.sun.star.uno.XComponentContext used for creating the CellBindingPropertyHandler is examined for a value with this name. If the object in this value denotes a spreadsheet document (indicated by supporting the com.sun.star.sheet.XSpreadsheetDocument interface), this document is used to create the com.sun.star.form.binding.ValueBindings to bind the inspected object to cells in this document.
