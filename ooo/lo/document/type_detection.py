    Service Class

    encapsulate a type detection service and provide read/write access on it's configuration data.
    
    It's possible to make a \"flat\" detection which may use internal configuration data only - or a \"deep\" detection which use special ExtendedTypeDetection services to look into the document stream. Last mode can be suppressed to perform the operation. Of course the results can't be guaranteed then. (e.g. in case the extension was changed)
