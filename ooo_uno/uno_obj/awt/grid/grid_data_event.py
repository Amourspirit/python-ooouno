    Struct Class

    used to notify changes in the data represented by an XMutableGridDataModel.
    
    Effectively, a GridDataEvent denotes a continuous two-dimensional cell range within a grid's data model, which is affected by a certain change.
    
    **since**
    
        OOo 3.3

    See Also:
        `API GridDataEvent <https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/structcom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1awt_1_1grid_1_1GridDataEvent.html>`_


    Note:
        | At runtime GridDataEvent will be an actual uno struct however can seamlessly be treated as a regualr class.
        | At design time a class is presumed. This allows for better typings.
        | GridDataEvent is a callable and can be treatead as a class and create instances.
