    Service Class

    this service is kind of storage that allows to store passwords and to retrieve already stored.
    
    A password can be stored for the session period or persistently. The persistent way is only possible if configuration allows to use storage. It stores passwords encrypted with a super password. An interaction is used to ask a user for a super password. To allow such an interaction, an object that implements XInteractionHandler interface should be provided. For this purpose InteractionHandler service can be used.
    
    In case no interaction handler is provided all passwords are stored for the session period. In case an interaction handler is provided, but the super password interaction does not return super password ( for any reason ), NoMasterException exception is thrown to let user use non-persistent way explicitly.
