    Service Class

    The AccessibleChartDocumentView service is supported by a Component that represents the view of a Chart document to provide an entry point to the document tree for accessibility.
    
    An object that implements the AccessibleChartDocumentView service provides information about itself and about the chart subcomponents contained in the chart document displayed in a window. This service gives a simplified view on the underlying implementation. It tries both to keep the structure of the accessibility representation tree as simple as possible and provide as much relevant information as possible.
