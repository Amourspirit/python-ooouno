    This is a specialized interface for bitmaps containing IEEE doubles for their color components.
    
    In contrast to XIeeeDoubleBitmap, this interface only permits read-only access.
    
    Use this interface for e.g. bitmaps that are calculated on-the-fly, or that are pure functional, and thus cannot be modified.
    
    If you get passed an instance of XHalfFloatReadOnlyBitmap that also supports the XVolatileBitmap interface, things become a bit more complicated. When reading data, one has to check for both VolatileContentDestroyedException and mismatching FloatingPointBitmapLayout return values. If either of them occurs, the whole bitmap read operation should be repeated.
