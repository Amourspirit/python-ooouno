    Service Class

    provides access to and information about properties and subproperties of an implementation.
    
    Properties in a property set may be full-fledged objects that have properties themselves (and so on recursively), thereby forming a hierarchy of properties. This service describes such a hierarchy, and allows direct access even to subproperties.
