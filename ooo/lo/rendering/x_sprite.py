        """
        Apply a clipping to the shape output.
        
        The given clip poly-polygon is always interpreted in device coordinate space. As the sprite has its own local coordinate system, with its origin on screen being equal to its current position, the clip poly-polygon's origin will always coincide with the sprite's origin. Furthermore, if any sprite transformation is set via transform(), the clip is subject to this transformation, too. The implementation is free, if it has a cached representation of the sprite at hand, to clip-output only this cached representation (e.g. a bitmap), instead of re-rendering the sprite from first principles. This is usually the case for an implementation of a XCustomSprite interface, since it typically has no other cached pictorial information at hand.
        
        Please note that if this sprite is not animated, the associated XSpriteCanvas does not update changed sprites automatically, but has to be told to do so via XSpriteCanvas.updateScreen().
        
        Specifying an empty interface denotes no clipping, i.e. everything contained in the sprite will be visible (subject to device-dependent constraints, of course). Specifying an empty XPolyPolygon2D, i.e. a poly-polygon containing zero polygons, or an XPolyPolygon2D with any number of empty sub-polygons, denotes the NULL clip. That means, nothing from the sprite will be visible.
