        Struct Class

        describes a set of Rules.
        
        A RuleSet is applied to a folder. It consists of a sequence of rules. Each rule consists of a sequence of RuleTerms describing the objects to which the rule should by applied and the RuleAction which should be performed on the matching objects.

        See Also:
            `API RuleSet <https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/structcom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1ucb_1_1RuleSet.html>`_


        Note:
            | At runtime RuleSet will be an actual uno struct however can seamlessly be treated as a regualr class.
            | At design time a class is presumed. This allows for better typings.
            | RuleSet is a callable and can be treatead as a class and create instances.
