    Service Class

    implements a property handler for use with a com.sun.star.inspection.ObjectInspector which provides properties related to binding form control models to XForm bindings.
    
    The handler introduces new properties to choose a com.sun.star.xforms.XModel and a com.sun.star.xforms.Binding within this model. Additionally, it introduces properties which reflect the different facets of the binding (e.g. com.sun.star.xforms.Binding.BindingExpression), so they can be changed directly in the com.sun.star.inspection.ObjectInspector as if they were a property of the form component which is being inspected.
    
    The handler expects a value named \"ContextDocument\" in the context in which it is created. That is, the com.sun.star.uno.XComponentContext used for creating the CellBindingPropertyHandler is examined for a value with this name. If the object in this value denotes a XML form document (indicated by supporting the com.sun.star.xforms.XFormsSupplier interface), this document is used to do XML binding related work.
