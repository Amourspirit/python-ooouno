    See XConfigurationController for a description of the configuration controller.
    
    This service is used at the moment by the XControllerManager to create a configuration controller. This allows developers to replace the default implementation of the configuration controller with their own. This may not be a useful feature. Furthermore the sub controllers may need a tighter coupling than the interfaces allow. These are reasons for removing this service in the future and let the controller manager create the sub controllers directly.
