    def Settings(self) -> 'XPropertySet_bc180bfa':
        """
        is a convenience wrapper around the Info property.
        
        Since fiddling around with a sequence of property values is somewhat uncomfortable in all known UNO language bindings (especially for tasks like simply changing the value of an existing value), the Settings property wraps the Info property for easier single-value access.
        
        You should use the Settings property if you need to access a few properties only, and the Info property if you need access to all existent settings at once.
        
        The object represented by this property supports the com.sun.star.beans.PropertyBag service. That is, you can at runtime add arbitrary new properties to the bag.
        
        Additionally, the property bag supports default values of properties, and thus the com.sun.star.beans.XPropertyState interface. If you add an own property to the bag using com.sun.star.beans.XPropertyContainer.addProperty(), you need to specify an initial value, which is also used as default value (exceptions see below).
        
        Effectively, the property bag represented by Settings contains two classes of properties: Pre-defined ones and user-defined ones.
        
        Pre-defined properties are properties which are potentially used by the data source, the application UI for the data source, or a particular backend driver employed by the data source. There's a large set of such properties, no all of them are effectively used for a concrete data source, nonetheless, they're all present in the Settings.Such properties are not removable from the bag, that is, their com.sun.star.beans.PropertyAttribute.REMOVABLE attribute is not set.Usually, you'll find that all of this properties have the com.sun.star.beans.PropertyState.PropertyState_DEFAULT_VALUE state.
        
        User-defined properties are the ones which are added at runtime by any instance. They might or might not be removable, this depends on whether or not the code adding them specifies the com.sun.star.beans.PropertyAttribute.REMOVABLE attribute. Also, they might or might not have a default value, determined by the com.sun.star.beans.PropertyAttribute.MAYBEDEFAULT attribute at the time they're added to the bag.
        
        When a data source is made persistent, then properties which are not removable (which are assumed to be the pre-defined properties) are ignored when they are in DEFAULT state. All other properties are always made persistent, except when an explicit com.sun.star.beans.PropertyAttribute.TRANSIENT attribute prohibits this.
        
        Similar, when you obtain the Info property of a DataSource, the Settings bag is asked for all its property values, and the ones which are removable and in state default are stripped, and not returned in the Info sequence.
