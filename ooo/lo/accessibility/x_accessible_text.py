    Implement this interface to give read-only access to a text.
    
    The XAccessibleText interface should be implemented by all UNO components that present textual information on the display like buttons, text entry fields, or text portions of the document window. The interface provides access to the text's content, attributes, and spatial location. However, text can not be modified with this interface. That is the task of the XAccessibleEditableText interface.
    
    The text length, i.e. the number of characters in the text, is returned by XAccessibleText.getCharacterCount(). All methods that operate on particular characters (e.g. XAccessibleText.getCharacterAt()) use character indices from 0 to length-1. All methods that operate on character positions (e.g. XAccessibleText.getTextRange()) use indices from 0 to length.
    
    Please note that accessible text does not necessarily support selection. In this case it should behave as if there where no selection. An empty selection is used for example to express the current cursor position.

        Returns a set of attributes that are associated for the character at the given index. To prevent the method from returning possibly large sets of attributes that the caller is not interested in the caller has to provide a list of attributes that he wants to be returned.

        The virtual character after the last character of the represented text, i.e. the one at position length is a special case. It represents the current input position and will therefore typically be queried by AT more often than other positions. Because it does not represent an existing character its bounding box is defined in relation to preceding characters. It should be roughly equivalent to the bounding box of some character when inserted at the end of the text. Its height typically being the maximal height of all the characters in the text or the height of the preceding character, its width being at least one pixel so that the bounding box is not degenerate.Note that the index \"length\" is not always valid. Whether it is or not is implementation dependent. It typically is when text is editable or otherwise when on the screen the caret can be placed behind the text. You can be sure that the index is valid after you have received an AccessibleEventId.CARET event for this index.
