    Struct Class

    This struct contains information describing a cross reference.
    
    Such references are kept by news servers for managing articles contained in multiple groups. An article can have a sequence of cross references.

    See Also:
        `API CrossReference <https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/structcom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1ucb_1_1CrossReference.html>`_


    Note:
        | At runtime CrossReference will be an actual uno struct however can seamlessly be treated as a regualr class.
        | At design time a class is presumed. This allows for better typings.
        | CrossReference is a callable and can be treatead as a class and create instances.
