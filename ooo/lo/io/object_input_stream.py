    Service Class

    is a stream which allows reading the data of persistent objects.
    
    Implementations of this service must fulfill the specifications of the DataInputStream service. It must be chained to an XMarkableStream. Therefore, it provides the XMarkableStream interface, and delegates the calls to the chained object.
    
    The written objects are held until this instance is destroyed. The references to the objects are read as four-byte integers. Data format reads:
