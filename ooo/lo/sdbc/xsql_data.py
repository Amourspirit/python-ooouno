        The implementation of the method must follow this protocol: It must read each of the attributes or elements of the SQL type from the given input stream. This is done by calling a method of the input stream to read each item, in the order that they appear in the SQL definition of the type. The method readSQL then assigns the data to appropriate fields or elements (of this or other objects). Specifically, it must call the appropriate XSQLInput.readXXX method(s) to do the following: for a Distinct Type, read its single data element; for a Structured Type, read a value for each attribute of the SQL type.
        
        The SDBC driver initializes the input stream with a type map before calling this method, which is used by the appropriate SQLInput.readXXX method on the stream.
