    Service Class

    provides information about an element within a hierarchy.
    
    The local name and the full hierarchical name can be retrieved. Attributes detailing the role of the element can be queried. The state of the element (regarding defaults) can be accessed.
    
    Implementations of this service usually also implement service HierarchyAccess, which concerns the complementary role of providing access to subelements of the hierarchy.
