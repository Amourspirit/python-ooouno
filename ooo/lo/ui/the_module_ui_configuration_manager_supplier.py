    Singleton Class

    specifies a central user interface configuration provider which gives access to module based user interface configuration managers.
    
    Controls module based user interface configuration managers.
    
    There can only exist one user interface configuration manager for a module. A user interface configuration manager supports to get and set user interface configuration data for configurable user interface elements.
    
    Prior to LibreOffice 4.3, this singleton was only available as a (single-instance) ModuleUIConfigurationManagerSupplier service.
    
    **since**
    
        LibreOffice 4.3
