    Deprecated: There is no equivalent in SfxItemState anymore due to not being used, so remove for simplification reasons and to prepare rework of Item/ItemSet/ItemPool stuff.
    
    There are only three usages of .ItemState in the code which all set the internal SfxItem to SfxVoidItem when triggered, which is equivalent to state SfxItemState.DISABLED (see e.g. SfxItemSet.GetItemState), so READ_ONLY gets not used in internal handling, even when eventually existing UNO API usages hand it over the office.
