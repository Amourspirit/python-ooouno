    Service Class

    implements a property handler for use with a com.sun.star.inspection.ObjectInspector which is able to enhance the com.sun.star.form.component.CommandButton.ButtonType and com.sun.star.form.component.CommandButton.TargetURL properties of a com.sun.star.form.component.CommandButton.
    
    For this, the two properties are superseded by new versions, where as button type, additional possible values are added for navigating the parent form of the button. For instance, in an com.sun.star.inspection.ObjectInspector using this handler, the user will be able to choose a button type saying \"move to the next record\", which, when chosen, well, moves the parent database form of the button to the next record.
