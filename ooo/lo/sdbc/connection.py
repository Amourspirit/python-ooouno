    Service Class

    represents a connection (session) with a specific database.
    
    Within the context of a Connection, SQL statements are executed and results are returned.
    
    A Connection's database is able to provide information describing its tables, its supported SQL grammar, its stored procedures, and the capabilities of this connection. This information is obtained with the com.sun.star.sdbc.XConnection.getMetaData() method.
    
    Note:  By default the Connection automatically commits changes after executing each statement. If auto commit has been disabled, an explicit commit must be done or database changes will not be saved.
