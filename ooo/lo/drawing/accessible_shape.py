    Service Class

    The AccessibleShape service is implemented by UNO shapes to provide accessibility information that describe the shape's features.
    
    A UNO shape is any object that implements the com.sun.star.drawing.XShape interface.
    
    The content of a draw page is modelled as tree of accessible shapes and accessible text paragraphs. The root of this (sub-)tree is the accessible draw document view. An accessible shape implements either this service or one of the \"derived\" services AccessibleGraphicShape or AccessibleOLEShape. See the section Children in the description of the com.sun.star.accessibility.XAccessibleContext interface support for more details.
    
    There are two services that extend this one: the AccessibleGraphicShape and the AccessibleOLEShape services provide additional interfaces. See there for details.
    
    A shape object is either fully or partially visible on the screen or has set the com.sun.star.accessibility.AccessibleStateType.DEFUNC state to indicate that it is no longer actively supported by its parent.
    
    Each shape object that has not set the DEFUNC state has a valid parent. That is either the containing draw page or a group shape or a 3D scene object.
