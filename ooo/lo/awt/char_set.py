    Const Class

    These values are used to specify the characters which are available in a font and their codes.
    
    The currently defined constants of CharSet have the same numerical values as the corresponding enum values of the C/C++ rtl_TextEncoding (from rtl/textenc.h). This correspondence is by design. Since CharSet is deprecated, however, it is not planned to add further constants to keep it in sync with rtl_TextEncoding.
