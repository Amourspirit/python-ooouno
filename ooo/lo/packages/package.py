    Service Class

    The Package is a service that provides access to a set of files and folders contained within a Package.
    
    One instance of the Package service exists for each Package file to be manipulated.
    
    Each instance is created with an argument which specifies the URL of the Package file to which the user requires access. If the instance is created without arguments, it must be initialized with the com.sun.star.lang.XInitialization service methods before it is a valid instance of the service.
