    Service Class

    is a one-instance service that provides access to a set of Contents via ContentProviders.
    
    Traditionally, this service implements com.sun.star.lang.XInitialization and needed to be instantiated once with two arguments via com.sun.star.lang.XMultiComponentFactory.createInstanceWithArgumentsAndContext() for configuration before it could be obtained via plain com.sun.star.lang.XMultiComponentFactory.createInstanceWithContext().
    
    However, the only pair of initialization arguments used in practice is \"Local\"/\"Office\", so this service is simplified now to automatically configure itself with that argument pair upon first instantiation.
    
    (For backwards compatibility, the service implementation still supports com.sun.star.lang.XInitialization and can still explicitly be initialized via com.sun.star.lang.XMultiComponentFactory.createInstanceWithArgumentsAndContext() with two arguments of type string. These strings are used as a pair of keys to retrieve a set of content provider descriptions from the configuration management (stored at org.openoffice.ucb.Configuration.ContentProviders.key1.SecondaryKeys.key2.ProviderData within the configuration management's hierarchy). The retrieved descriptions are in turn used to register the corresponding content provider services at the broker.)
