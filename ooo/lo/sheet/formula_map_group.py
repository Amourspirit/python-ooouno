    Constants of bit masks used with XFormulaOpCodeMapper.getAvailableMappings() to specify for which group of symbols the mappings are to be obtained.
    
    If no bit is set, a sequence of special mappings is returned in the order that is defined by FormulaMapGroupSpecialOffset. Note that the special group and other groups are mutual exclusive.
