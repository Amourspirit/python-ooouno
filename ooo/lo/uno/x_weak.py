    the server-side interface to a weak object.
    
    This interface is proxy to the adapted object. In order to make it possible to have weak references to objects, the XAdapter interface must be implemented to provide a weak adapter for the clients.
    
    This module specifies the interfaces for implementing and using weak references.
    
    The sense of weak references is to hold a reference to an object without affecting the lifetime of the object. That means that a weak reference may become invalid, at any time, if the referenced object dies.
    
    The following interfaces describe one way to handle weak references by providing a weak adapter. The weak object has to provide this adapter if anyone wants to hold a weak reference. To separate their lifetimes, the adapter and the original object must not share the same reference counter. The weak reference is in fact only a hard reference to the adapter, which knows - but does not hold - the original object. That means that the implementation and synchronization of weak referencing is the responsibility of the object. The following interfaces are involved in the concept of weak referencing:
