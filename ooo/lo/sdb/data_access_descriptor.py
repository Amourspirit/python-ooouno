    descriptor for accessing basic data access objects.
    
    Various components interacting with the database access world require to specify (or provide themselves) an object such as a query, a table, a result set, a connection to a data source, a column within a table, and so on.All of these objects are usually not specified with a single property, but with a set of properties, and for various objects, various (but not always different) properties are needed.The DataAccessDescriptor describes the super set of the properties for the most common data access objects.
    
    Every component providing or requiring a DataAccessDescriptor for some functionality is urged to specify which properties are mandatory, and which ones optional. Additionally, it's free to specify any additional requirements about the relations of properties.
