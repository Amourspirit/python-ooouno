    these types describe the algorithm to be used to search a frame
    
    Such flags will be used on methods XFrame.findFrame(), XDispatchProvider.queryDispatch() or XComponentLoader.loadComponentFromURL() if no special target frame name (e.g. \"_blank\", \"_self\") is used.

    allow the search outside the current sub task tree of the whole possible frame tree
    
    If this flag isn't present, any search from bottom to top has to stop, if a top frame will be reached. It doesn't influence a search from top to bottom. But it can be used at the root of the frame tree to search on direct children of it only. Because the direct children of the root node are the root's of the task sub trees, which are top frames too. Instead of using the CHILDREN flag there, it's possible so to suppress a deeper search so.
