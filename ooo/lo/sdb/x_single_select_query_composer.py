        sets a new elementary query for the composer
        
        An elementary query or statement is a (single select) statement whose parts are not covered by the various set and get methods of the composer. That is, if the elementary statement contains a filter clause, a call to XSingleSelectQueryAnalyzer.getFilter() will not return you this filter. Instead, only filters which have been set using for instance setFilter() are covered by the get methods.
        
        The only methods which take all parts of the elementary statement into account are XSingleSelectQueryAnalyzer.getQuery() and XSingleSelectQueryAnalyzer.getQueryWithSubstitution(), which always returns the complete composed query.
        
        As a result, you can use the composer to build cumulative filter expressions. That is, you can set ElementaryQuery to a statement already containing filters, and then use setFilter() to append additional filters.
        
        The very same holds for sort orders, HAVING and GROUP BY clauses.
        
        There are various use cases for this. For instance, you might want to use the statement represented by a QueryDefinition, and extend it with additional filters or sort orders, while not touching the respective parts already present in QueryDefinition.Command. This can be achieved by setting the QueryDefinition.Command as ElementaryQuery of a SingleSelectQueryComposer.
        
        If, in such a scenario, you would be interested in the filter part of the QueryDefinition.Command, you would set it via XSingleSelectQueryAnalyzer.setQuery(), and retrieve the filter part via XSingleSelectQueryAnalyzer.getFilter().
        
        If you'd be interested in the composed filter, you would set the QueryDefinition.Command as ElementaryQuery, add your filter, and propagate the resulting query (XSingleSelectQueryAnalyzer.getQuery()) to an SingleSelectQueryAnalyzer instance via XSingleSelectQueryAnalyzer.setQuery().
