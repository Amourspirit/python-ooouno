    This interface is implemented by any drop target context object.
    
    A drop target context is created whenever the logical cursor associated with a Drag and Drop operation moves within the visible geometry of a window associated with a drop target.
    
    The drop target context provides the mechanism for a potential receiver of a drop operation to both provide the end user with the appropriate drag under feedback and effect the subsequent data transfer, if appropriate.
