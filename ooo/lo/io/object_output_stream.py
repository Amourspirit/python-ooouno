    Service Class

    is a stream which allows writing the data of persistent objects.
    
    Implementations of this service must fulfill the specifications of the DataOutputStream service; furthermore, the stream needs to be chained to a XMarkableStream. Therefore, it also provides the XMarkableStream interface, but it delegates the calls to the chained object. The written objects are held until this instance is destroyed. The references to the objects are written as four-byte integers and begin at 1. Data format is written:
