    """
    Implement this interface to represent a hyperlink or a group of hyperlinks.
    
    Single hyperlinks correspond to simple <a href> tags. Groups of hyperlinks are contained in client side image maps. Linked objects and anchors are implementation dependent. This interface inherits the XAccessibleAction interface. Especially that interface's XAccessibleAction.getActionCount() method is needed to obtain a maximum value for the indices passed to the XAccessibleHyperlink.getAccessibleActionAnchor() and XAccessibleHyperlink.getAccessibleActionObject() methods.
    
    Furthermore, the object that implements this interface has to be connected implicitly or explicitly with an object that implements the XAccessibleText interface. The XAccessibleHyperlink.getStartIndex() and XAccessibleHyperlink.getEndIndex() methods return indices with respect to the text exposed by that interface.
