    specifies the standard model of a UnoControlSpinButton.
    
    A spin button is a control which has a numeric value associated with it, and allows to change this value using two spin buttons.
    
    A spin button is similar to a scroll bar, but it usually has no (own) visual representation of the associated value, but is used to propagate its value to other controls.
