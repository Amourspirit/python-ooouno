    Struct Class

    This structure lets an event give access to a change of a table model.
    
    The data members of the AccessibleTableModelChange structure give access to the type and cell range of a change of a table model. See AccessibleTableModelChangeType for details of the change type. The range of the affected rows, columns, and/or cells can be obtained by accessing the other four data members.
