        The change of the location makes it necessary to store the document in a format that the object can load. For this reason the implementation of XStorable.storeAsURL() will throw an exception if a pure export filter is used, it will accept only combined import/export filters. For such filters the method XStorable.storeToURL() must be used that does not change the location of the object.
