class TextSegment(object):
    """
    Struct Class

    This structure describes a text segment that is embedded in a larger portion of text.
    
    It is used for example by the XAccessibleText interface to describe a text portion that was inserted into or deleted from an accessible text.
    
    The indices TextSegment.SegmentStart and TextSegment.SegmentEnd refer to the enclosing text. The TextSegment.SegmentText member contains the text between these two indices including the start index but not the end index. With it you can use this structure without having to access the XAccessibleText interface that represents the enclosing text.
    
    An empty text segment is expressed by TextSegment.SegmentStart and TextSegment.SegmentEnd set to the same value. While a value of -1 signals an error (like the request for a word after the last character of a text) all other values define the empty string at that position.
    
    The SegmentText member is a copy of the corresponding text segment of the enclosing text. Modifying this structure does not alter the enclosing text.
    
    **since**
    
        OOo 1.1.2

    Note:
        | At runtime TextSegment will be an actual uno struct however can seamlessly be treated as a regualr class.
        | At design time a class is presumed. This allows for better typings.
        | TextSegment is a callable and can be treatead as a class and create instances.
