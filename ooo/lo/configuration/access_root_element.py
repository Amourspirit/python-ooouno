    Service Class

    provides information about the root element of a hierarchy and about the hierarchy as a whole.
    
    Provides information about the element and the whole hierarchy. Allows controlling the lifetime of the hierarchy. Allows observing changes in the hierarchy as a whole.
    
    When access to a hierarchy is first obtained from a factory or provider, this is the initial object that is created by the factory. It represents the root of the accessible part of the hierarchy.
    
    NOTE: In this description \"hierarchy\" may actually designate a part or fragment of a larger hierarchy. It is that part that is rooted in the element represented by an implementation of this service and that is accessible starting from this element.
    
    Generally it is not possible to navigate the parent or siblings, if any, of this element, so com.sun.star.container.XChild is not supported.
