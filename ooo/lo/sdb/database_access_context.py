    Service Class

    is the context for data access beans.
    
    It allows to register aliases for database access beans. It is possible to have different aliases for different locales.
    
    A DatabaseContext stores an alias for the URL of a database access component for a given locale. It is also allowed to work with a default locale. This is useful in connection with Enumeration or NameAccess to the context. In common use, the default language is set during the initialization of the component.
    
    The service also provides a default handling for locales, where an alias isn't set. The first time an alias is registered for a programmatic name, the alias becomes the default for all other known locales.
