    Service Class

    describes a control used for displaying images stored in a database.
    
    The model of the control has to support the com.sun.star.form.component.DatabaseImageControl service.
    
    If the model of the control is valid bound to a database field, the control allows to select an image (browsing the file system) upon double clicking into it, and forwards the URL of the chosen image to the ImageURL property of its model.
