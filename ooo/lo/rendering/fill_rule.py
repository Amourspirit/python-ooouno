    Fill every area, where, when traveling along a line, the summed winding number (that is, -1 for a counter-clockwise-oriented polygon, and +1 for a clockwise-oriented) is non-zero.
    
    For example, a poly-polygon consisting of two concentric circles with similar orientation is filled the same way as if only the outer circle would exist. If both have opposite orientation, then the filled representation looks the same as if filled with the EVEN_ODD fill rule.
