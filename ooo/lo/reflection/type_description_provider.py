    Service Class

    This service provides type descriptions, i.e.
    
    concrete service implementations read from source like the persistent registry database format.
    
    This old-style service definition mostly serves documentation purposes. It is not intended that an implementation of this service can be obtained at the global service manager using this service identifier.
