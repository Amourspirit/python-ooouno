    Service Class

    provides a proofreader (often known as grammar checker) for text
    
    An implementation of this service will receive text and has to identify the sentence end and report all errors found.
    
    An implementation of this service is not limited to grammar checking at all. It might also check style, used terms etc. Basically it can check every aspect of a single sentence. Since the text provided is always the complete paragraph it can also choose to analyze the context of the sentence currently required to be checked. However error reports need to be limited to the current sentence.
