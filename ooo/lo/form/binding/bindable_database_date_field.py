    Service Class

    This service specifies a date input field which is data-aware and thus can be bound to a database field, and additionally supports binding to arbitrary external values.
    
    If a com.sun.star.form.binding.ValueBinding instance is set at the field, it will exchange it's content with the binding as com.sun.star.util.Date.
