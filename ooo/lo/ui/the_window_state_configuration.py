    Singleton Class

    a singleton which provides window based information about user interface elements.
    
    OpenOffice.org has an amount of user interface elements that can be positioned, resized, closed and their style can be changed. This singleton provides access to the window based information of available user interface elements which are part of OpenOffice.org modules, like Writer or Calc.
    
    Provides access to window based information about user interface elements of all installed application modules.
    
    To access the window based information of a module, a unique module specifier must be provided to com.sun.star.container.XNameAccess.getByName() function. The module specifier can be retrieved from the com.sun.star.frame.ModuleManager service. The interface provides references to a com.sun:star.ui.ModuleWindowStateConfiguration.
    
    Prior to LibreOffice 4.3, this singleton was only available as a (single-instance) WindowStateConfiguration service.
    
    **since**
    
        LibreOffice 4.3
