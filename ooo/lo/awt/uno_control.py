    Service Class

    specifies an abstract control.
    
    All components which implement this service can be integrated in a windowing environment. This service describes the controller of the Smalltalk model view controller design.
    
    You must set a model and a stub to the UnoControl before using other methods. The implementation only allows the change of the graphics (XView) if the window is not visible. The change of the graphics in visible state should redirect the output to these graphics, but this behavior is implementation-specific.
    
    The change of data directly at the control may not affect the model data. To ensure this behavior, modify the data of the model.
