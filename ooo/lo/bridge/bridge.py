    Service Class

    This meta service allows the bridgefactory service to instantiate an interprocess bridge using a certain transfer protocol.
    
    Components, that support a certain protocol, must have at least two service names:
    
    The protocol name should be written as common servicenames, first letter is a capital letter, the rest in small letters postfixed by Bridge (e.g.: com.sun.star.bridge.UrpBridge would be correct servicename for the \"urp\" protocol). However, the protocol names are compared case insensitive. If there exist two services supporting the same protocol, it is arbitrary which one is chosen, so this should be omitted.
