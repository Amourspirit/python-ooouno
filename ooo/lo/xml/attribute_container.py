    Service Class

    This service describes a container for XML attributes.
    
    Each attribute is accessed with its local name, or optionally, its local name with its namespace prefix. The type and value of an attribute is stored in a AttributeData struct. If you use a namespace in the AttributeData, you must use a prefix in the name and you must use a namespace, if you use a prefix.
