    supports to notify other implementations about changes of a user interface configuration manager.
    
    The XUIConfiguration interface is provided for user interface configuration managers which need to broadcast changes within the container; that means the actions of adding, replacing and removing elements are broadcast to listeners.
    
    This can be useful for UI to enable/disable some functions without actually accessing the data.
