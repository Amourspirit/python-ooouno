    Service Class

    defines the binding to a single cell in a table document
    
    Read/Write access to the cell represented by this component is supported, as well as active broadcasting of value changes.
    
    The binding supports exchanging double values, string values.
    
    The component cannot be instantiated at a global service factory, instead it's usually provided by a document instance.
