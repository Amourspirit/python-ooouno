    allows to make UNO objects persistent
    
    Every UNO object, that wants to be serializable, should implement this interface. The object stores stores itself, when the write method is called.
    
    The object needs to be created before it deserializes itself again (by using the read method). Therefore it must be creatable by name via a factory, which is in general the global service manager. The create and read mechanism is implemented by the com.sun.star.io.ObjectInputStream.
    
    The serialization format (the series of strings, integers, objects) must be specified at the specification of the concrete service.
    
    The interface does not support any special versioning mechanism.
