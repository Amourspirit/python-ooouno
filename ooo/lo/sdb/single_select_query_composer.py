    Service Class

    represents a service for composing a single select statement.
    
    It hides the complexity of parsing and evaluating a single select statement and provides sophisticated methods for expanding a statement with filter, group by, having and order criteria. To get the new extended statement use the methods from com.sun.star.sdb.SingleSelectQueryAnalyzer.
    
    A SingleSelectQueryComposer is usually obtained from a Connection using the com.sun.star.lang.XMultiServiceFactory interface.
