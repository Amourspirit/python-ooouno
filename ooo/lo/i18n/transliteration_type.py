    Bitmask transliteration types used with XTransliteration.getType() and XTransliteration.getAvailableModules() methods.
    
    Non-IGNORE type modules provide XTransliteration.transliterate(). IGNORE type modules provide XTransliteration.equals() and XTransliteration.transliterateRange().

    A transliteration module is ONE_TO_ONE if and only if it's mapping between characters is one to one like a-z to A-Z.

    A transliteration module can have attribute NUMERIC if it transliterates numbers in different languages like Chinese numbers to Arabic numbers and vice versa.
