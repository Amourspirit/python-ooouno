    is the representation (mapping) of an SQL BLOB.
    
    A SQL  BLOB  is a built-in type that stores a Binary Large Object as a column value in a row of a database table. The driver implements  BLOB  using a SQL locator(BLOB) , which means that a Blob object contains a logical pointer to the SQL  BLOB  data rather than the data itself. A Blob object is valid for the duration of the transaction in which is was created.
    
    Methods in the interfaces com.sun.star.sdbc.XResultSet , and com.sun.star.sdbc.XPreparedStatement , such as getBlob and setBlob allow a programmer to access the SQL BLOB. The Blob interface provides methods for getting the length of a SQL  BLOB  (Binary Large Object) value, for materializing a  BLOB  value on the client and for determining the position of a pattern of bytes within a  BLOB  value.
