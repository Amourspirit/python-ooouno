    represents a sheet link.
    
    A sheet link contains the source data of linked sheets, i.e. the URL and sheet name of the external document.
    
    To create a linked sheet, the sheet which will be used as linked sheet has to exist already. The method XSheetLinkable.link() creates a SheetLink object in the document's SheetLinks collection and links the sheet to the specified external sheet.
