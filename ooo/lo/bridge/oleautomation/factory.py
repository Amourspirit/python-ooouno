    makes it possible to create COM objects as UNO objects.
    
    A COM object must have a ProgId since the ProgId is used as argument for com.sun.star.lang.XMultiServiceFactory.createInstance(). The only interfaces which are mapped are IUnknown and IDispatch. The created UNO objects support com.sun.star.script.XInvocation if the original COM objects support IDispatch.
    
    The optional parameters of the method com.sun.star.lang.XMultiServiceFactory.createInstanceWithArguments() are reserved for future use; at this time they are ignored.
