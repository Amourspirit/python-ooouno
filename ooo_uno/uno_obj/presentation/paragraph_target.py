    Struct Class

    an event has a source that causes an event to be fired and a trigger that defines under which condition an event should be raised and an offset if the event should be raised a defined amount of time after the event is triggered.

        `API ParagraphTarget <https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/structcom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1presentation_1_1ParagraphTarget.html>`_


    Note:
        | At runtime ParagraphTarget will be an actual uno struct however can seamlessly be treated as a regualr class.
        | At design time a class is presumed. This allows for better typings.
        | ParagraphTarget is a callable and can be treatead as a class and create instances.
