    This interfaces gives access to a dictionary entry.
    
    A dictionary entry can supply a word and its hyphenation and indicate if it is a negative word. If it is a negative entry it may supply a replacement text to be used instead of the entry word.
    
    Hyphenation positions are represented by an \"=\" in the word. If the \"=\" is the last character of the word this means it should not be hyphenated. If there is no \"=\" charter in the word, hyphenation positions will be determined automatically (i.e., from the hyphenator service alone).
    
    Entries whose words only differ in hyphenation are considered to be equal. Also a \".\" at the end of the word will make no difference.
