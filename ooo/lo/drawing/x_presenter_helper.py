    This interface is a collection of functions that were necessary to implement larger parts of the presenter screen as extension.
    
    The methods of this interface give access to services that could only be implemented in the Office core, not in an extension.
    
    As the presenter screen is no extension any more, this hack can go again; it just needs clean-up.
