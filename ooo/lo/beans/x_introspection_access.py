    represents the result of an introspection operation done by the inspect method of XIntrospection.
    
    This interface gives information about an object's properties and methods as detected in the introspection process. It's not possible to access properties or call methods directly using this interface but it provides access to other interfaces to do so. See com.sun.star.beans.XIntrospectionAccess.queryAdapter()
    
    The XExactName interface has to be supported in order to implement inaccurate name access for all objects which implement the com.sun.star.container.XNameAccess interface or XPropertySet.
    
    The XMaterialHolder interface has to be supported to give access to the inspected object.
