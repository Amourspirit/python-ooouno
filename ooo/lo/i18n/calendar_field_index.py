class CalendarFieldIndex(object):
    """
    Const Class

    Field indices to be passed to various XCalendar methods.
    
    Field is writable only if marked both Get/Set.
    
    ZONE_OFFSET and DST_OFFSET cooperate such that both values are added, for example, ZoneOffset=1*60 and DstOffset=1*60 results in a time difference of GMT+2. The calculation in minutes is GMT = LocalTime - ZoneOffset - DstOffset
    
    With introduction of ZONE_OFFSET_SECOND_MILLIS and DST_OFFSET_SECOND_MILLIS the exact calculation in milliseconds is GMT = LocalTime
