    Service Class

    is the basic service for pooling SDBC connections.
    
    When the method com.sun.star.sdbc.XPooledConnection.getConnection() is called, the ConnectionPool will attempt to locate a suitable pooled connection or create a new connection from the DriverManager. When the connection will be released it will move to the pool of unused connections.
