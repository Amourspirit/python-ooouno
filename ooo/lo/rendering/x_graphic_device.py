    This interface provides access to a graphic device, such as a printer, or a screen device.
    
    Every canvas (
    
    For a typical windowing system, the graphic device is equivalent to a distinct OS window, with its own clipped output area, fullscreen and double-buffering attributes. That is, even if one can have multiple canvases per system window, they all share the same graphic device and thus e.g. fullscreen state. If the OS restrictions are in such a way that fullscreen or double-buffering is screen-exclusive, i.e. that per screen, only one object can have this state, it might even be that all windows on the screen share a common graphic device.
