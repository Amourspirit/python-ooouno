    provides a function to retrieve a special purpose interface dependent on the user interface element type.
    
    The type of the interface depends on the real type of the user interface element. A menubar user interface element provides access to its com.sun.star.awt.XSystemDependentMenuBarPeer which supports to retrieve the system dependent menu handle. A floating window or a toolbar user interface element return a com.sun.star.awt.XWindow interface.
