    Struct Class

    This class is the base class for DropTargetDragEvent and DropTargetDropEvent.
    
    To access the XDropTarget that originated this event, use the com.sun.star.lang.EventObject.Source member of this object.

    See Also:
        `API DropTargetEvent <https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/structcom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1datatransfer_1_1dnd_1_1DropTargetEvent.html>`_


    Note:
        | At runtime DropTargetEvent will be an actual uno struct however can seamlessly be treated as a regualr class.
        | At design time a class is presumed. This allows for better typings.
        | DropTargetEvent is a callable and can be treatead as a class and create instances.
