    Service Class

    is an abstract service for a component which offers a deeper integration of desktop components than a com.sun.star.awt.XWindow can offer
    
    Such components can be loaded into a Frame inside a Desktop environment. A controller is a richer component then a pure window, but full featured components need a XModel interface too. (see service com.sun.star.document.OfficeDocument for further information)
