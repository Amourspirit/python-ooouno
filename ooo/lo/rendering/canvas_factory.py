    Service Class

    The CanvasFactory is used to create the Canvas objects, evaluating the user's configuration preferences from.
    
    /org.openoffice.VCL/Settings/Canvas/PreferredServices.
    
    The latter specifies a string list of service names to use.
    
    Instantiating this service, you can use its com.sun.star.lang.XMultiComponentFactory interface to create Canvas objects, passing an empty string as service specifier (default). If you want to manually override the configured service list, you can pass a service name to try first.
