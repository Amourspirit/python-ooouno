    factory to create filter components.
    
    After a generic TypeDetection an internal type name will be known. Further a generic com.sun.star.frame.FrameLoader can use this information, to search a suitable filter (may the default filter) at this factory and use it for loading the document into a specified frame.
    
    This factory implements read/write access on the underlying configuration set. and further a validate and flush mechanism for more performance and a special query mode can be used here too.
