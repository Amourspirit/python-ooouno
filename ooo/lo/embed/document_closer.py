    Service Class

    The main task of this service is to close an office document frame embedded in an application running in another process correctly.
    
    The usual usage of this service is to create it, initialize with document frame, and to dispose the service. While disposing the service will do all the required actions to let the frame be closed using com.sun.star.util.XCloseable.close( true ). Thus in case there is a code that prevents closing of the frame the code automatically becomes the owner of the frame.
    
    In addition the code will disconnect the VCL window the frame is based on from the container system window.
