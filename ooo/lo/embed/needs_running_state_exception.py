    Exception Class

    This exception can be thrown in case a list of accepted verbs of states is requested and the object is in loaded state and this information can be retrieved only when the object is in running state.
    
    This exception means that the object supports at least running state in addition to the loaded state. Other states and possible verbs can be detected only after object is switched to running state.
