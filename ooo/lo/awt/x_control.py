    Implementations of this interface are abstract windows. The main reason to instantiate this implementation is to show the window on the screen. Before the window appears on the screen, the XControl.createPeer() method must be called.
    
    If the implementation of the control does not distinguish between model, view and controller, it must allow to set a new XGraphics in the view, so that the control can be printed.
