    Service Class

    specifies the model of a control used for displaying images stored in a database.
    
    As every com.sun.star.form.DataAwareControlModel, an image control can be bound to a database field. This means that for instance with every record change, the content of the database field is taken, interpreted as image, and displayed in the control.Unlike other more text-based controls, it does not interpret the content of the field as text or double, but as binary stream (see com.sun.star.sdb.XColumn.getBinaryStream()).
    
    Usually, an image control model can be bound to binary columns only, namely com.sun.star.sdbc.DataType.BINARY, com.sun.star.sdbc.DataType.VARBINARY, com.sun.star.sdbc.DataType.LONGVARBINARY, com.sun.star.sdbc.DataType.OTHER, com.sun.star.sdbc.DataType.LONGVARCHAR
    
    Note that besides taking the image to be displayed from the bound field, there is another option. The com.sun.star.awt.UnoControlImageControlModel.ImageURL property specifies the URL of an image to be displayed. If this property is changed from outside, the respective file is loaded and set as image source.
    
    In a usual data form, the scenario will be as follows:
