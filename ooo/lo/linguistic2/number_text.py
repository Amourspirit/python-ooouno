    provides converter to spell out numbers and money amounts
    
    An implementation of this service will receive text and has to spell out as cardinal, ordinal, ordinal indicator or money amounts.
    
    An implementation of this service is not limited to number to number conversion at all. It might also support other linguistic functions of a given language, for example, spelling out years, gender and formal variants or complex affixation of number names, or article selection.
