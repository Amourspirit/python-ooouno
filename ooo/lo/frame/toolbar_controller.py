    Service Class

    is an abstract service for a component which offers a more complex user interface to users within a toolbar.
    
    A generic toolbar function is represented as a button which has a state (enabled,disabled and selected, not selected). A toolbar controller can be added to a toolbar and provide information or functions within a more sophisticated user interface.A typical example for toolbar controller is the font chooser within the toolbar. It provides all available fonts in a dropdown box and shows the current chosen font.
