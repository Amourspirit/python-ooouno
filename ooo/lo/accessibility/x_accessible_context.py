    Implement this interface for exposing various aspects of a class's content.
    
    This interface serves two purposes: On the one hand it gives access to the tree structure in which all accessible objects are organized. Each node in this tree supports this interface. On the other hand it gives access to objects that expose the represented content. That are role, state, name, description, and relations to other objects. Take an OK button of a dialog as an example. Its role is AccessibleRole.BUTTON, its name is \"OK\", and its description is something like \"Accepts all changes made in the dialog\".
