    Service Class

    is used for executing a static SQL statement and obtaining the results produced by it.
    
    Only one ResultSet per Statement can be open at any point in time. Therefore, if the reading of one ResultSet is interleaved with the reading of another, each must have been generated by different Statements. All statement execute methods implicitly close a statement's current ResultSet if an open one exists.

        `API Statement <https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/servicecom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1sdbc_1_1Statement.html>`_

        This name can then be used in SQL positioned update/delete statements to identify the current row in the ResultSet generated by this statement. If the database does not support positioned update/delete, this property is a noop. To ensure that a cursor has the proper isolation level to support updates, the cursor's SELECT statement should be of the form \"select for update ...\". If the \"for update\" phrase is omitted, positioned updates may fail.
        
        Note:  By definition, positioned update/delete execution must be done by a different Statement than the one which generated the ResultSet being used for positioning. Also, cursor names must be unique within a connection.
