    Service Class

    is used for executing a static SQL statement and obtaining the results produced by it.
    
    Only one ResultSet per Statement can be open at any point in time. Therefore, if the reading of one ResultSet is interleaved with the reading of another, each must have been generated by different Statements. All statement execute methods implicitly close a statement's current ResultSet if an open one exists.
