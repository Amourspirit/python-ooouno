        Note:
            | At runtime PolyPolygonShape3D will be an actual uno struct however can seamlessly be treated as a regualr class.
            | At design time a class is presumed. This allows for better typings.
            | PolyPolygonShape3D is a callable and can be treatead as a class and create instances.
