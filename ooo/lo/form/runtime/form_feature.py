    moves the form to a record given by absolute position.
    
    This operation cannot be executed without arguments. When executing it (i.e. when calling com.sun.star.form.runtime.XFormOperations.executeWithArguments()), you need to specify a parameter named Position of type long, which denotes the position to move the form to.
    """
    TotalRecords = 2
    """
    determines the number of total records in the form, including the potentially active insertion row.
    
    This is not strictly an operation you can do on a form, but rather a state you can retrieve (and display to the user) using the XFormOperations's respective methods.
    
    The state obtained here is a string, not a number. This is because in an UI form, the fact that the current record count is not yet known (since not all records have been visited, yet) is indicated by an asterisk (*) besides the record count.

    opens a dialog which allows the user to interactively specify a form sorting order
    """
    AutoFilter = 15
    """
    adds a filter to the form, which is defined by the active form control and its current value
    
    For instance, if the currently active form control is bound to a table field named Price, and currently has a value of 100, then invoking the AutoFilter operation will put an additional filter Price = 100 on the form.

    RemoveFilterAndSort = 18
    """
    removes all filter and sort criteria put on the form.
    
    Note that this does not apply to criteria which are part of the form's data source. That is, if you bind the form to the SQL command SELECT * FROM Articles WHERE Price > 100, then the Price > 100 filter will not be removed.
    
    Effectively, this operation resets the com.sun.star.sdb.RowSet.Filter and com.sun.star.sdb.RowSet.Order properties of the form.
