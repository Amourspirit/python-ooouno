class XSQLInput(XInterface_8f010a43):
    """
    represents an input stream that contains a stream of values representing an instance of a SQL structured or distinct type.
    
    This interface, used only for custom mapping, is used by the driver behind the scenes, and a programmer never directly invokes SQLInput methods.
    
    When the method getObject is called with an object of a service implementing the interface SQLData , the SDBC driver calls the method com.sun.star.sdbc.XSQLData.getSQLType() to determine the SQL type of the user-defined type (UDT) being custom mapped. The driver creates an instance of com.sun.star.sdbc.XSQLInput , populating it with the attributes of the UDT. The driver then passes the input stream to the method com.sun.star.sdbc.XSQLData.readSQL() , which in turn calls the XSQLInput.readXXX methods in its implementation for reading the attributes from the input stream.
