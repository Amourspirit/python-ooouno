    describes a wizard which can be used to copy table like data from one database to another.
    
    Copying table data between databases can be a complex task. Especially when it comes to matching field types in the source and in the target database, some heuristics, and sometimes support from the user doing the operation, are required.
    
    The copy table wizard described by this interfaces cares for those, and other, settings.
