        Enum of Const Class AccessibleRole

        Collection of roles.
        
        This collection of constants defines the set of possible roles of classes implementing the XAccessible interface according to the Java class javax.accessibility.AccessibleRole. The role of an object describes its generic function like \"button\", \"menu\", or \"text\". You can obtain an object's role by calling the getAccessibleRole() method of the XAccessibleContext interface.
        
        We are using constants instead of a more typesafe enum. The reason for this is that IDL enums may not be extended. Therefore, in order to include future extensions to the set of roles we have to use constants here.
        
        For some roles there exist two labels with the same value. Please use the one with the underscores. The other ones are somewhat deprecated and will be removed in the future.
