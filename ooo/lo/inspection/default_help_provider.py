    implements a component which can default-fill the help section of an ObjectInspector.
    
    The component registers a XPropertyControlObserver at an XObjectInspectoryUI interface. Whenever it then is notified of a XPropertyControl getting the focus, it will try to deduce the extended help text of this control's window, and set this help text at the object inspector's help section.
