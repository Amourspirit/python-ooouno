    The configuration controller is responsible for the management of the set of active resources.
    
    There are two configurations of resources:
    
    When the two configurations differ then the current configuration is updated eventually to reflect the requested configuration. An update takes place when the following three conditions are fulfilled.
    
    Requests for configuration changes are handled in a two step process:
