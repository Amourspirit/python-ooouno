    This interface is implemented by a view or window that supports drag operations and will be received as part of a DragGestureEvent through a com.sun.star.datatransfer.dnd.XDragGestureListener.dragGestureRecognized() callback.
    
    Differently to Java, the association between view and interface is fixed and can not be changed. Otherwise, the AWT messaging would have to be implemented for any window supporting Drag and Drop operations, which would be a real performance issue.
