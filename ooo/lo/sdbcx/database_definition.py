    Service Class

    could be used as an extension for performing data definition tasks on databases, and to control the access rights on database objects.
    
    It may be implemented by a database driver provider, to encapsulate the complexity of data definition, and to give a common way for data definition as the DDL of most DBMS differs.
    
    At least, the access to the tables of a database should be implemented. The implementation of other known database objects like views is optional.
    
    To control the access rights of users, there is the possibility to implement objects like users and groups.
