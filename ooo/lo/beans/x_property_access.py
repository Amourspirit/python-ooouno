    makes it possible to access all property values and to set them at once.
    
    In most cases this interface will be in addition to XPropertySet. It is especially useful for remote communication because it lessens the number of calls for getting property values; that is especially important because these calls are necessarily synchronous.
    
    Another advantage of this method is that conflicts are avoided if property value restrictions depend on the value of other properties.
