    Service Class

    represents an AutoFormat, containing exactly 16 AutoFormat fields.
    
    Each of the 16 fields contain formatting properties for a table cell at a specific position in the AutoFormat range. The rows of the range are divided into a header row, a footer row and 2 data rows (repeated in turn between header and footer row). The columns are divided similar. This results in 16 different types of cells in the range. The AutoFormats are numbered row by row, then column by column.
