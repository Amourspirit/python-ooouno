    Service Class

    provides access to a dynamic, homogeneous, nonhierarchical set of values or objects.
    
    Also provides information about the template for elements. Allows normalizing externally generated names.
    
    Sets are dynamic containers.
    
    The number and names of contained elements is not fixed in advance, but all elements have to be of one predetermined type.
