    Service Class

    specifies a diagram which can be used for presenting stock quotes.
    
    Note that the data must have a specific structure for stock diagrams. Let us assume that data is interpreted, such that series are taken from columns (see property Diagram.DataRowSource). Then you need tables of the following structures for different types:
    
    StockDiagram.Volume is FALSEStockDiagram.UpDown is FALSE
    
    StockDiagram.Volume is TRUEStockDiagram.UpDown is FALSE
    
    StockDiagram.Volume is FALSEStockDiagram.UpDown is TRUE
    
    StockDiagram.Volume is TRUEStockDiagram.UpDown is TRUE

        indicates if a stock chart contains data representing the value of stocks on the opening and closing date.
        
        The difference will be indicated by bars. The color of the bar will be significant for positive or negative differences between open and closed data.
        
        If this property is FALSE, the values of the first series (or second if StockDiagram.Volume is TRUE) of the chart data are interpreted as the day's lowest value. The next series is interpreted as the day's highest value, and the last series is interpreted as the closing value.
        
        If this property is set to TRUE, one additional series is needed with the opening value of the stocks. It is assumed as the series before the series with the day's lowest value.
