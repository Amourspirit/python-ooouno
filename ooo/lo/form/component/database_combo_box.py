    Service Class

    This service specifies a combo box which is data-aware, and can be bound to a database field.
    
    Like most other data aware controls, such a combo box will display the actual content of the field it is bound to. In addition, as a combo box contains a list where the user can choose items to fill into the control, this list can be filled with different data from a database, too.
