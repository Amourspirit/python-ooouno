    Provides read access to a ContentResultSet.
    
    You can either get a simple static ContentResultSet or you can listen to change-notifications and then swap from the old to a new ContentResultSet.
    
    The following describes the dynamic use:
    
    XDynamicResultSet provides the possibility to get notifications about changes on a ContentResultSet and have an listener-controlled update from one version to the next version. Two ContentResultSet implementations were given to the listener in the first notification as interface com.sun.star.sdbc.XResultSet.
    
    To get notifications the listener has to be of type XDynamicResultSetListener.
    
    After registration you will get notifications for events of type ListEvent.
    
    The calling of XDynamicResultSetListener.notify() has to happen in an own thread, because it could take a longer time and any actions ??? until the listener returns the call. So don't block the notify-causing action.
    
    While one notify-call is going on:
    
    After the listener has returned the notify-call:
