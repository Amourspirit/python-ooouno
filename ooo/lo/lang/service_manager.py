    Service Class

    Provides a collection of implementations for services.
    
    This is a singleton you commonly find in your component context under key /singletons/com.sun.star.lang.theServiceManager.
    
    The factories are accessed with a service name. It is possible to access the factories with their implementation names, but you should avoid this.
    
    Service factories added via com.sun.star.container.XSet should support the following interfaces:
    
    Since LibreOffice 3.6, in addition to instances of XServiceInfo et al, the com.sun.star.container.XSet of at least the default C++ service manager implementation now also supports sequences of com.sun.star.beans.NamedValue in insert and remove. The sequence elements must each have a Name of uri and a string Value that is the URI of a service rdb. It is legal for there to be no such uri elements. For insert, there can additionally be an optional element with a Name of component-context and a value that is a non-null reference of type com.sun.star.uno.XComponentContext that shall be used instead of this service manager's default component context when loading the corresponding implementations.
