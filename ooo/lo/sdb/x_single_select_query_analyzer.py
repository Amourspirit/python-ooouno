        returns the query previously set at the analyzer, with all application-level features being substituted by their database-level counterparts.
        
        The XSingleSelectQueryAnalyzer is an application-level component, which in some respect understands SQL features usually not present at the database level. As a prominent example, you might pass a SELECT statement to the analyzer which is based on another query.
        
        While all other methods will handle those additional features transparently - e.g. the query in the FROM part of a SELECT statement will be handled as if it really is a table -, getQueryWithSubstitution gives you the SQL statement where all those features have been stripped, and replaced with appropriate standard SQL.
        
        For example, consider a database document which contains a client-side query named All Orders. This query is not known to the underlying database, so an SQL statement like SELECT * from \"All Orders\" would be rejected by the database. However, instantiating a SingleSelectQueryAnalyzer at the Connection object, and passing it the above query, you can then use getQueryWithSubstitution to retrieve a statement where \"All Orders\" has been replaced with the SELECT statement which actually constitutes the \"All Orders\" query.
