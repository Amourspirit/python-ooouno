    marks an object representing an ODF element that may have RDF meta data attached.
    
    To make using ODF elements as part of RDF statements more convenient, this interface inherits from XURI. The URI is constructed by concatenating the URI of the document, the stream name, a fragment separator, and the XML ID.
    
    Note that using the XURI interface on an instance of XMetadatable may have the side effect of creating a metadata reference for the instance.
