class DispatchResultEvent(EventObject_a3d70b03):

    Struct Class

    contains the result of the dispatch action, if State is set to SUCCESS
    
    The type of the result is dispatch action dependent. The member State can be set to one of the values defined in DispatchResultState. If State is set to DispatchResultState.FAILURE, Result may specify the reason (or is empty). The type is also dispatch action dependent. If State is set to DispatchResultState.DONTKNOW, Result is empty.

        Other Arguments:

                However ``**kwargs`` are still passed so parent class.
