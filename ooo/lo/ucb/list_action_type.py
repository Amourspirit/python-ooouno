    A change happened is sent from an XDynamicResultSet as ListAction to a XDynamicResultSetListener.
    
    The values are contained in ListAction.ListActionType.

    First notification to a single listener for purpose of initialization.
    
    This type of notification is required to be sent first and only once to a new listener.
    
    The member ListAction.ActionInfo is required to contain a struct WelcomeDynamicResultSetStruct. This struct contains two com.sun.star.sdbc.XResultSets (old and new). During and after the notification only the new set is valid for access. But the listener is required to remind both com.sun.star.sdbc.XResultSets as he will not get another chance to get them again.
