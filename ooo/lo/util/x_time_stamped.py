    provides timestamp information for an object in the form of an arbitrary string.
    
    The format and meaning of the timestamp depends on the implementation. Services implementing this interface must document the meaning and format they use.
    
    If the timestamp is unchanged between two calls, the associated object has not changed. Any properties beyond this, particularly the presence of a meaningful order between timestamps, depend on the implementation.
