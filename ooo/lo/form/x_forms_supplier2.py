        If you need read access to the forms collection, then you might check the existence of forms using hasForms(), and if it returns FALSE, you can do as if XFormsSupplier.getForms() would have returned an empty container.
        
        Semantically, hasForms() is equivalent to calling XElementAccess.hasElements() on the container returned by XFormsSupplier.getForms(). But when using the latter, the implementation is forced to create an empty container, which might be potentially expensive.
