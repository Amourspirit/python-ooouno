    represents a starting point for Single Sign-on interactions.
    
    The Single Sign-on ( SSO ) APIs provide UNO based access to underlying SSO implementations ( e.g. Kerberos ). The aim of the SSO APIs is to enable authentication ( possibly mutual ) between a client ( source or initiator ) and a network service ( target or acceptor ). This is achieved via. the creation and processing of security tokens sent between the two parties. The steps which should be followed to successfully use the SSO APIs are as follows:
    
    The interface supports the creation of XSSOManager instances which can subsequently be used to create security contexts.
