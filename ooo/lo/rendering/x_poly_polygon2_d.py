        One can do symbolic path construction with this method. The poly-polygons added by this method are not joined in the sense that they participate in mutual fill rule calculations like the polygons inside a single poly-polygon do. When rendering such a poly-polygon without transparency, it will look like the constituting poly-polygons rendered separately on top of another. Alas, when rendering with transparency, separate rendering will combine the alpha of overlapping areas, whereas addPolyPolygon results in constant alpha, regardless how many internal poly-polygons overlap at a single place.
