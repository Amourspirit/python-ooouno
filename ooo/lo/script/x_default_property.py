    An object supporting this interface indicates to interested parties or clients the name of the default property for this object.
    
    For example where ExampleObject is an instance of an Object that supports this interface which returns the default property name \"Value\".A scripting engine could use this information to support syntax like
    
    ExampleObject = \"foo\"
    
    which would be equivalent to writing
    
    ExampleObject.Value = \"foo\"
