    An XAccessControlContext is used to make system resource access decisions based on the context it encapsulates.
    
    More specifically, it encapsulates a context and has methods to check permissions equivalent to XAccessController interface, with one difference: The XAccessControlContext makes access decisions based on the context it encapsulates, rather than that of the current execution thread.

        The semantics are equivalent to the security permission classes of the Java platform.
        
        You can also pass a sequence of permissions (sequence< any >) to check a set of permissions, e.g. for performance reasons. This method quietly returns if the access request is permitted, or throws a suitable AccessControlException otherwise.
