    is used for inspecting multiple results produced by the execution of a SQL statement.
    
    Under some (uncommon) situations a single SQL statement may return multiple result sets and/or update counts. Normally you can ignore this unless you are (1) executing a stored procedure that you know may return multiple results or (2) you are dynamically executing an unknown SQL string. The methods com.sun.star.sdbc.XMultipleResults.getMoreResults() , com.sun.star.sdbc.XMultipleResults.getResultSet() and com.sun.star.sdbc.XMultipleResults.getUpdateCount() let you navigate through multiple results.
