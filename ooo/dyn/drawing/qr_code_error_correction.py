        These constants identify the type of Error Correction for a QR Code.
        
        The Error Correction for a QR code is a measure that helps a QR code to recover, if it is destroyed.
        
        Level L (Low) 7% of codewords can be restored. Level M (Medium) 15% of codewords can be restored. Level Q (Quartile) 25% of codewords can be restored. Level H (High) 30% of codewords can be restored.
