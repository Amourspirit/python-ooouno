In this case, the parameter will be filled from the corresponding master field.Alternatively, you could simply base your report on the table invoices, and add the column name cust_ref to the DetailFields. In this case, and implicit filter clause WHERE cust_ref = :<new_param_name> will be created, and the artificial parameter will be filled from the corresponding master field.If a string in this property denotes both a column name and a parameter name, it is undefined which way it is interpreted, but implementations of the service are required to either decide for the parameter or the column, and proceed as usual.
