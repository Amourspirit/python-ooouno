If TRUE, the object positioning algorithm will consider the text wrap style, set at the floating screen object. The attribute BaseFrameProperties.WrapInfluenceOnPosition specifies how the text wrap is considered. If FALSE (default value), the former object positioning algorithm (known from OpenOffice.org 1.1) is applied.
