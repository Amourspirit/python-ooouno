    Service Class

    is the base for AddIn services that supply functions which can be called by other components.
    
    Any AddIn implementation must implement a service describing its specific set of functions. That service must contain the AddIn service, and the functions that are implemented, in one or more interfaces. The com.sun.star.lang.XServiceName interface must describe that service, and the XAddIn interface must describe the individual functions.
    
    Each AddIn function can take parameters of the following types:
    
    Each AddIn function must have one of the following return types:
    
    The sequences must contain arrays as described above for the parameter types. An XVolatileResult return value must contain an object implementing the VolatileResult service, that contains a volatile result. Subsequent calls with the same parameters must return the same object. An any return value can contain any of the other types.
