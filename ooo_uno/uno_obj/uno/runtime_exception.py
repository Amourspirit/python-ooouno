class RuntimeException(Exception_85530a09):
    """
    This exception or a subclass can occur at every interface method.
    
    It shall signal an error, which was not covered by the interface method specification. This exception (or a derived one) is thrown, when for instance an interprocess bridge to the object broke down, some explicitly forbidden invalid parameters were passed ( e.g. null references ) or the called object has been disposed before.
