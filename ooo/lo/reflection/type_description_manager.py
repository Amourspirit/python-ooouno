    Service Class

    This service manages type descriptions and acts as a central access point to every type description.
    
    It delegates calls for demanded types to subsequent com.sun.star.reflection.TypeDescriptionProviders and may cache type descriptions.Using cppuhelper's bootstrapping routines bootstrapping an initial component context, there is a singleton accessible via key \"/singletons/com.sun.star.reflection.theTypeDescriptionManager\". This singleton object is hooked into the C UNO runtime typelib and lives until the context is shut down.
