    Service Class

    implements a property handler for use with a com.sun.star.inspection.ObjectInspector which provides convenience wrappers for some properties existing at a form component derived from com.sun.star.awt.UnoControlEditModel.
    
    First, the handler supersedes the HScroll and the VScroll properties of a com.sun.star.awt.UnoControlEditModel and puts them into one common property, allowing the user to choose whether she want to have \"no\", a \"vertical\", a \"horizontal\", or \"both\" scrollbars.
    
    Second, if it detects a com.sun.star.form.component.RichTextControl to inspect, it supersedes the com.sun.star.form.component.RichTextControl.RichText and the com.sun.star.awt.UnoControlEditModel.MultiLine properties with a new one which allows choosing the text type with one single action.
