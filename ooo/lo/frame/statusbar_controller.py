    Service Class

    is an abstract service for a component which offers a more complex user interface to users within a status bar.
    
    A generic status bar function is represented as a text field which provides status information to the user. A status bar controller can be added to a status bar and provides information or functions with a more sophisticated user interface.A typical example for a status bar controller is the zoom level chooser within the statusbar. It provides an option to change the zoom level of an application.
