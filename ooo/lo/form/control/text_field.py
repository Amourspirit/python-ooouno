    Service Class

    describes a control for entering arbitrary text which can (but not necessarily has to) be bound to a database field.
    
    The model of the control has to support the com.sun.star.form.component.TextField service.
    
    In addition, this control can be used in HTML forms. It triggers the com.sun.star.form.XSubmit.submit() method of the form it belongs to if the enter is pressed while it has the focus.
