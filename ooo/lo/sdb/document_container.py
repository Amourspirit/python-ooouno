    Service Class

    describes a container which provides access to documents embedded into a database document, usually forms and reports.
    
    The com.sun.star.lang.XMultiServiceFactory.createInstanceWithArguments() should be used to create sub document container or form, or report objects.
    
    The embedded documents do not support any particular database related service, instead, they're usual com.sun.star.document.OfficeDocuments.The only thing worth mentioning here is that they support the com.sun.star.container.XChild interface, whose com.sun.star.container.XChild.getParent() method can be used to obtain the database document which the embedded document belongs to.
