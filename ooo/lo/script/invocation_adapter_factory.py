    Service Class

    Provides functionality to create an adapter that supports (a) special interface type(s) and maps calls to the interface's methods to an invocation interface.
    
    An adapter like this allows generic dispatch interfaces to meet interface requirements, e.g. if a specific listener interface has to be passed to an add...Listener method.
    
    The adapter has to support com.sun.star.script.XInvocationAdapterFactory. The adapter may also support com.sun.star.script.XInvocationAdapterFactory2.
