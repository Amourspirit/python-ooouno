        Struct Class

        This permission represents access to a file or directory.
        
        A FilePermission consists of a file url and a set of actions valid for that url.
        
        The path of the file url that ends in \"/*\" indicates all the files and directories contained in that directory. A path that ends with \"/-\" indicates (recursively) all files and subdirectories contained in that directory. A file url string consisting of the special token \"<<ALL FILES>>\" matches any file.
        Note: A file url string consisting of a single \"*\" indicates all the files in the current directory, while a string consisting of a single \"-\" indicates all the files in the current directory and (recursively) all files and subdirectories contained in the current directory.
        The actions to be granted is a list of one or more comma-separated keywords. The possible keywords are \"read\", \"write\", \"execute\", and \"delete\". Their meaning is defined as follows:
        
        The actions string is processed case-insensitive.

        Note:
            | At runtime FilePermission will be an actual uno struct however can seamlessly be treated as a regualr class.
            | At design time a class is presumed. This allows for better typings.
            | FilePermission is a callable and can be treatead as a class and create instances.
