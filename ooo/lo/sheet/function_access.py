        specifies whether the function call is performed as array function call.
        
        If set to TRUE, the result of the function call will be calculated similar to array formulas in a spreadsheet document. The return value of the function call will usually be a sequence of sequences containing the values of the resulting array. Example: If the function ABS is called for a 3x2 cell range, the result will be a 3x2 array containing the absolute values of the numbers contained in the specified cell range.
        
        If set to FALSE, the result of the function call will be calculated similar to simple cell formulas in a spreadsheet document. The return value of the function call will usually be a single value. Of course, some functions always return an array, for example the MUNIT function.
        
        For compatibility with older versions, the default value of this property is TRUE.
