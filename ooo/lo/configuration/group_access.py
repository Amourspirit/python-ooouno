    Service Class

    provides access to a predefined heterogeneous group of values and nested trees as part of a hierarchy.
    
    Provides access to, and information about, its children and descendants viewed either as properties or as contained elements.
    
    Groups are static collections within the hierarchy.
    
    The number and names of contained elements are fixed in advance and each child may have a different type.
    
    This service subsumes two alternate ways of accessing child and descendent elements. These strongly overlap, supporting the basic identity xGroup.getPropertyValue( aName ) == xGroup.getByName( aName ).
