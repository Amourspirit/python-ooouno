        This is necessary mostly because the DOM implementation does not permit attaching namespaces declarations directly to nodes, which may lead to duplicate namespace declarations on export, and thus larger documents. Note that the first part of each tuple is the prefix, e.g. \"office\", and the second is the full namespace URI.
