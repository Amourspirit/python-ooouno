    Service Class

    This service specifies a form which is a group of FormComponents.
    
    A form fulfills several tasks, like storing the structure of its form components, storing the information concerning tab ordering and control grouping, and last but not least, it provides the event environment for its contained elements.
    
    A form acts on the one hand like a container of FormComponents and on the other hand like a FormComponent. This generic construction allows the definition of hierarchies of forms and their dependent subforms.
