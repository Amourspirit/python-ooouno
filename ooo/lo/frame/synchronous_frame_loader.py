    Service Class

    derivations of this abstract service are used to load components into Frames of the environment
    
    Concrete implementations of this service register, for example, for file name extensions or MIME types to load appropriate components. The components loaded are at least Controller. Instead of service FrameLoader this one use synchronous processes to load the component.
