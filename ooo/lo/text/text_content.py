    is an object which can be anchored in a text, like instances of TextFrame or TextField.
    
    If the concrete TextContent has a textual representation which fades into the surrounding text, then XTextField is used.
    
    If the concrete TextContent has a \"floating\" object, like a graphic, com.sun.star.drawing.XShape is used.
