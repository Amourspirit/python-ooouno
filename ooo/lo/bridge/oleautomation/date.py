    Struct Class

    is the UNO representation of the Automation type DATE.
    
    A DATE could actually be represented as double in UNO and therefore a typedef from double to a date type would do. But a typedef cannot be expressed in all language bindings. In the case where no typedefs are supported the actual type is used. That is, a typedef'd date type would be represented as double in Java. The information that the double is a date type is lost.
    
    When calling Automation objects from UNO the distinction between double and date type is important. Therefore Date is declared as struct.
