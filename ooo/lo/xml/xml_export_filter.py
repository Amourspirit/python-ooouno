    Service Class

    describes an export filter for XML-based file formats.
    
    It is an extension of com.sun.star.document.ExportFilter and differs from it only in that an com.sun.star.xml.sax.XDocumentHandler needs to be passed through the XInitialization interface. This XDocumentHandler will then be used to export the XML data stream.
