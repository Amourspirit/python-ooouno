class JavaInitializationException(DeploymentException_ffd30e2a):
    """
    indicates that there is no Java available
    
    It is presumed that Java is a vital part of an office installation. That is, if Java does work for some reason, it is not guaranteed that the office is functional. A JavaInitializationException is therefore caused by some misconfiguration of Java which is closer described by other exceptions in this namespace which inherit JavaInitializationException. These are:
    
    com.sun.star.java.JavaDisabledException
    com.sun.star.java.JavaNotConfiguredException
    com.sun.star.java.MissingJavaRuntimeException
    com.sun.star.java.JavaVMCreationFailureException
    
    **since**
