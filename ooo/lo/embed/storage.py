    Service Class

    This is a service that allows to get access to a package using storage hierarchy.
    
    A root storage should be retrieved by using StorageFactory service. Substorages are created through XStorage interface of a parent storage.

        Usually means that the document validity is questionable, although the package itself is not corrupted. The decision about document validity in this case is in application hands. It is up to user of the storage to decide whether he accepts the fallback approach for an implementation of this service, outputs a warning or an error.
