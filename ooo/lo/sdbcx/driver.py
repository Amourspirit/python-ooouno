    Service Class

    extends the service com.sun.star.sdbc.Driver by beans for data definition.
    
    This service is optional for each driver. Its purpose is to define a common way for database definition, as the DDL differs between most DBMS.
    
    Definition and deletion of database catalogs can't be defined in a common manner for DBMS, but it should be possible to hide much of the complexity of creation and deletion of catalogs. Each driver could provide methods to cover these tasks.
