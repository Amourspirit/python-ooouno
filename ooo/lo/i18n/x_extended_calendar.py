        Returns a string (number or name to display) matching the given code constant.
        
        Note that the string returned depends completely on the locale's calendar. It is not predictable if the string will be numeric or a name, or if in case it returns a numeric string how many digits that will have. For example, a short year display string will normally be two digits with a Gregorian calendar, but with a Jewish calendar it will have three digits.
