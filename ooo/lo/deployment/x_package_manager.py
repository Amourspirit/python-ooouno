    The XPackageManager interface is used to add or remove packages to a specific repository.
    
    This interface represents a particular repository. Packages are deployable files, e.g. scripts or UNO components.
    
    Adding a UNO package means that a copy of the package is stored in the repository.
    
    Removing a UNO package means that the previously added package is removed from the repository.
    
    All interface methods do neither register nor revoke an extension. This happens exclusively by XExtensionManager.
    
    Objects of this interface are created using the XPackageManagerFactory service resp. the singleton  /singletons/com.sun.star.deployment.thePackageManagerFactory .
