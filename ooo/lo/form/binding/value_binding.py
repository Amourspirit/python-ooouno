        As long as this property is TRUE, the value binding should throw an InvalidBindingStateException when its XValueBinding.setValue() method is invoked.

        In a more complex scenario, where different form controls are bound to different values, which all are part of a larger data structure, some of the items in this data structure may not be relevant currently. This is indicated by the Relevant property being FALSE.
        
        XBindableValues which are bound to this binding may or may not react in certain ways on the (ir)relevance of their bound value.
        
        One possible reaction could be that user interface elements which are associated with the XBindableValue are disabled as long as Relevant is FALSE.
