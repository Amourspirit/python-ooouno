    Service Class

    This service acts as a container for graphics.
    
    The main interface that has to be implemented for this service is the XGraphic interface, which itself exposes only a few methods. Beside this, a Graphic service incorporates the GraphicDescriptor to give access to the attributes of the graphic.
