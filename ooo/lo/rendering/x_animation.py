        Render the animation content at time t into the specified canvas.
        
        Note that it is perfectly legal to e.g. map t in a nonlinear fashion to internal frames, for example to achieve acceleration or deceleration effects. It is required that the render method has const semantics, i.e. when called with the same parameter set, identical output must be generated. This is because e.g. a Sprite might decide arbitrarily to render an animation once and cache the result, or repaint it via XAnimation.render every time.
        
        The rendered content, although, must be exactly the same for identical viewState, canvas and t values. Or, for that matters, must call the same canvas methods in the same order with the same parameter sets, for identical viewState and t values. Furthermore, when viewState has the identity transformation set, rendered output must be contained in a rectangle with upper left corner at (0,0) and width and height given by the AnimationAttributes' untransformedSize member. Any content exceeding this box might get clipped off.
