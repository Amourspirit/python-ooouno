    Service Class

    Implementation of this service can keep any properties and is useful when an XPropertySet is to be used, for example, as parameters for a method call.
    
    Scripting engines might not be able to use such objects as normal property sets, giving direct access to the properties. In this case, use the methods like XPropertySet.getPropertyValue().
