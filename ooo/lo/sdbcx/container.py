    Service Class

    describes every container which is used for data definition.
    
    Each container must support access to its elements by the element's name or by the element's position.
    
    Simple enumeration must be supported as well.
    
    To reflect the changes with the underlying database, a refresh mechanism needs to be supported.
    
    A container may support the possibility to add new elements or to drop existing elements. Additions are always done by descriptors which define the properties of the new element.
