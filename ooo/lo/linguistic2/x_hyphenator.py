    provides functionality for hyphenation of single words.
    
    Its three main functionalities are to provide a suitable position for breaking lines within a word, query about the existence of an alternative spelling at a specific position of a word and provide a list of possible hyphenation positions within a word.
    
    A hyphenation position for a word with n characters is represented by a value in the range from 0 to n-2, indicating the position of the character after which the hyphenation is done. That is, it is after the first and before the last character.
    
    A valid hyphenation position is a hyphenation position that fulfills all the restrictions implied by the properties MinLeading, MinTrailing and MinWordLength.
