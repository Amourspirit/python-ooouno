    Service Class

    provides access to a hierarchy of descendant elements.
    
    Subnodes are accessed by their name. Values that are direct or indirect descendants of this tree node can be retrieved. Non-value subnodes can be navigated using container interfaces. Other interfaces provide access to information about this node. Changes to values in the subtree can be monitored by event listeners.
    
    Elements of this container that are not simple values are similar containers themselves, thus (recursively) forming a hierarchical tree.
    
    Implementations of this service usually also implement service HierarchyElement, which concerns the complementary role of being accessible as an element of the hierarchy.
