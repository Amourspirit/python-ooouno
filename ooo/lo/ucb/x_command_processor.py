        This identifier can be used to abort the execution of the command associated with that identifier. Note that it is generally not necessary to obtain a new id for each command, because commands are executed synchronously. So the id for a command is valid again after a command previously associated with this id has finished. In fact you only should get one identifier per thread and assign it to every command executed by that thread.
        
        Also, after a call to XCommandProcessor.abort(), an identifier should not be used any longer (and instead be released by a call to XCommandProcessor2.releaseCommandIdentifier()), because it may well abort all further calls to XCommandProcessor.execute().
        
        To avoid ever-increasing resource consumption, the identifier should be released via XCommandProcessor2.releaseCommandIdentifier() when it is no longer used.
