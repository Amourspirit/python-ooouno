    Implement this interface to represent a selection of accessible objects.
    
    This interface is the standard mechanism to obtain and modify the currently selected children. Every object that has children that can be selected should support this interface.
    
    The XAccessibleSelection interface has to be implemented in conjunction with the XAccessibleContext interface that provides the children on which the first operates.
    
    It depends on the class implementing this interface, whether it supports single or multi selection.
