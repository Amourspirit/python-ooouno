        creates a label that describes the origin of this data sequence.
        
        This is useful, if a XLabeledDataSequence has no label sequence. In this case you can call this method at the value sequence to obtain a fitting replacement label.
        
        The sequence returned here may be empty if no suitable label can be generated.
        
        The strings returned should be localized.
        
        If you have a non quadratic range you can ask for labels for the longer side with parameter LONG_SIDE or you can obtain labels for the shorter side with parameter SHORT_SIDE.
        
        If the range is not structured in a tabular way you may receive no label.
        
        Example: Assuming this sequence has a Range representation spanning row 5 and 6 in column 8. Following sequences of strings or similar strings are expected as return values:
        
        generateLabel( SHORT_SIDE ) -> \"Column 8\" generateLabel( LONG_SIDE ) -> \"Row 5\" \"Row 6\" generateLabel( COLUMN ) -> \"Column 8\" generateLabel( ROW ) -> \"Row 5\" \"Row 6\"
        
        Which strings exactly you return depends on the naming scheme of the application which provides its tabular data.
