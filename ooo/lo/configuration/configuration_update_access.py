    Service Class

    provides modifying access to a fragment of the configuration hierarchy.
    
    Extends ConfigurationAccess to support modifying values or inserting and removing elements.
    
    Descendants of this service also implement this service unless they are marked read-only (which is indicated by attribute com.sun.star.beans.PropertyAttribute.READONLY), in which case they only need implement ConfigurationAccess.
    
    The classification of implementations that is described for ConfigurationAccess applies to implementations of this service as well. Therefore an implementation will support one of several alternate services describing its Container role and one of several alternate services describing its Element role. These services are extensions of the respective services documented for ConfigurationAccess.
