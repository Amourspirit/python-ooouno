    Named Item
    
    If a base item name is specified, the reference value for a combination of field items is the result where the item in the base field is replaced by the specified base item.
    
    If the reference value isn't shown in the DataPilot table because of hidden details for a parent field, the difference isn't calculated and an error value is shown.
    
    If the result for an item combination is empty, the value 0 is used for the difference, even if the summary function is undefined without values, like average or variance. The difference is shown in the result table even if the original result was empty.
    
    The difference for item combinations containing the base item is shown as empty result.
    
    Previous or Next
    
    If \"previous\" or \"next\" is specified as the base item, the reference value is the result for the next visible member of the base field, in the base field's sort order. If details for one item in the base field are hidden, that item is skipped. The difference for the item with hidden details isn't calculated, not even for the item's summary, to have a consistent order of previous and next items.
    
    Empty results are handled as for named items (see above).
