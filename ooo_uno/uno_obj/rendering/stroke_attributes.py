        Struct Class

        This structure contains all attributes required for path stroking.
        
        Path stroking is the process of drawing a polygon with a thick pen. The various attributes contained in this structure can be used to customize that process.

        See Also:
            `API StrokeAttributes <https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/structcom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1rendering_1_1StrokeAttributes.html>`_


        Note:
            | At runtime StrokeAttributes will be an actual uno struct however can seamlessly be treated as a regualr class.
            | At design time a class is presumed. This allows for better typings.
            | StrokeAttributes is a callable and can be treatead as a class and create instances.
