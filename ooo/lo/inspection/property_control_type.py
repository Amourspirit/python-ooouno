    Const Class

    describes pre-defined possible control types to be used to display and enter property values within an ObjectInspector.
    
    The type of a control determines its visual appearance, its behavior, and - important for property handlers using a control - the expected type when reading and writing the control's value.

If you use this interface to add additional entries to the list box, which have no color associated with it, then you can also exchange values as string. That is, if you write a string into XPropertyControl.Value, and if this string has previously been added to the list using the XStringListControl interface, this string is selected. Vice versa, if the user selects one of those non-color strings in the list, then reading XPropertyControl.Value will retrieve you this string.
