    Service Class

    implements a general-purpose XPropertyHandler
    
    The property handler implemented by this service will do an introspection on the provided components, and expose the properties obtained via XIntrospectionAccess.getProperties.
    
    The handler will automatically determine the best type of property control to represent a certain property, depending on the property type. This includes, for example, list box controls to represent enumeration properties.
