    Service Class

    is the service that every driver class must implement.
    
    Each driver should supply a service that implements the Driver interface.
    
    The DriverManager will try to load as many drivers as it can find and then for any given connection request, it will ask each driver in turn to try to connect to the target URL.
    
    It is strongly recommended that each Driver object should be small and standalone so that the Driver object can be loaded and queried without bringing in vast quantities of supporting code.
    
    Each driver should be a one instance service.
